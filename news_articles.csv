This release is in addition to normal GST compensation being released every two months out of actual cess collection.Subsequent to the 43rd GST council meeting held on May 28, 2021, it was decided that the central government would borrow Rs 1.59 lakh crore and release it to states and union territories with the legislature on a back-to-back basis to meet the resource gap due to the short release of compensation on account of the inadequate amount in the compensation fund.This amount is as per the principles adopted for a similar facility in Financial Year 2020-2021, where an amount of Rs 1.10 lakh crore was released to states under a similar arrangement. This amount of Rs 1.59 lakh crore would be over and above the compensation in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore (based on cess collection) that is estimated to be released to states, union territories with legislature during this financial year. The sum total of Rs 2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in FY 2021-2022.All eligible states and UTs (with Legislature) have agreed to the arrangements of funding of the compensation shortfall under the back-to-back loan facility. For effective response and management of COVID-19 pandemic and a step-up in capital expenditure, all states and union territories have a very important role to play. For assisting the states/UTs in their endeavour, the Ministry of Finance has frontloaded the release of assistance under the back-to-back loan facility during FY 2021-22 of Rs 1,59,000 crore.The release of Rs 44,000 crore being made now is funded from borrowings of government in five-year securities issued in the current financial year, at a Weighted Average Yield of 5.69 per cent. No additional market borrowing by the central government is envisaged on account of this release.It is expected that this release will help the states, union territories in planning their public expenditure among other things, for improving, health infrastructure and taking up infrastructure projects.

में सौरमंडल हमारा बैकयार्ड बन सकता है...अगर ऐसा हुआ तो हम पृथ्वी पर दुर्लभ संसाधनों का अंतरिक्ष से दोहन कर सकते हैं।""अमेरिका स्थित एसईटीआई इंस्टीट्यूट के खगोलविदों ने स्पेस मिशन न्यू होराइज़न के डेटा का अध्ययन कर बताया है कि प्लूटो की सतह पर करीब चार अरब वर्ष पहले बड़ी मात्रा में नाइट्रोजन की जमी हुई परतें थीं। बतौर अध्ययन, प्लूटो के मौसम में बहुत तेज़ी से हुए परिवर्तन के कारण वहां मौजूद नाइट्रोजन की परतें गैस में बदल गईं।चीन ने 'कृत्रिम सूर्य' बनाया है जो सूर्य के कोर से लगभग 6 गुना अधिक तापमान (10 करोड़ डिग्री सेल्सियस) उत्पन्न करने में सक्षम है। इस प्रोजेक्ट का उद्देश्य सूर्य पर होने वाली प्रक्रियाओं की तरह हाइड्रोज़न का इस्तेमाल कर कम लागत में हरित ऊर्जा (ग्रीन एनर्जी) बनाना है। इससे पहले चीन 'कृत्रिम चंद्रमा' भी विकसित कर चुका है।कनाडा का एक वीडियो सामने आया है जिसमें तेज़ बहती हवाओं के चलते जंगल की सतह 'सांस लेती दिख' रही है जबकि इस क्षेत्र में काफी पेड़ हैं। शोधकर्ताओं का दावा है कि ऐसी घटनाएं तब होती हैं जब ज़मीन में पानी की मात्रा अधिक होती है जिसके कारण मिट्टी और पेड़ों की जड़ों का जुड़ाव कमज़ोर हो जाता है।इंटरनैशनल स्पेस स्टेशन (आईएसएस) में मिले छेद को लेकर नासा के अधिकारी जिम ब्रिडेन्स्टाइन ने कहा है कि बिना किसी साज़िश और अफवाह के इसकी जांच होनी चाहिए। उन्होंने कहा, ""मुझे

स्टीफन हॉकिंग ने मृत्यु से पहले अपनी किताब में लिखा था, ""ईश्वर और जन्नत नाम की कोई चीज़ नहीं है...ब्रह्मांड को कोई भी संचालित नहीं कर रहा है।"" उन्होंने भविष्य के बारे में बताते हुए कहा, ""हां भी और नहीं भी...सिद्धांत हमें भविष्य का अनुमान लगाने की अनुमति देते हैं लेकिन व्यावहारिक रूप से यह बहुत कठिन है।""अमेरिकी वैज्ञानिकों ने चूहों पर अध्ययन कर दावा किया है कि मच्छर से होने वाला ज़ीका वायरस 'ग्लायोब्लास्टोमा' (सामान्यतया होने वाला दिमागी कैंसर) के लिए ज़िम्मेदार कैंसर कोशिकाओं को नष्ट कर सकता है। बतौर अध्ययन, यह वायरस शरीर में कैंसर स्टेम सेल्स (कोशिकाएं) को निशाना बनाता है। इस अध्ययन का प्रयोग मानव पर 18 महीने के अंदर हो सकता है।यूरोपीय और जापानी स्पेस एजेंसी द्वारा बुध ग्रह के लिए लॉन्च हुए 7 वर्षीय मिशन के तहत 'बेपीकोलंबो' स्पेसक्राफ्ट ने अंतरिक्ष से पहली सेल्फी भेजी है जिसमें उसके सोलर पैनल और सन सेंसर दिख रहे हैं। गौरतलब है, 1973 और 2004 के मिशन के बाद बुध के लिए यह तीसरा मिशन है जो 2025 में बुध की कक्षा में पहुंचेगा।अमेरिकी वैज्ञानिकों को एक वानर प्रजाति के दांत का 1.25 करोड़ साल पुराना जीवाश्म मिला है जिसके मुताबिक यह दुनिया में अब तक की सबसे छोटी वानर प्रजाति हो सकती है। विलुप्त हो चुकी इस 'सिमिलस मिन्यूटस' प्रजाति के वानरों का वज़न सिर्फ 3.6 किलोग्राम था। बतौर वैज्ञानिक, जीवाश्म से पता चला है कि ये बंदर पत्तियां खाते थे।स्टैनफोर्ड यूनिवर्सिटी (अमेरिका) के वैज्ञानिकों ने रक्त में पाए जाने वाले डीएनए फ्रैगमेन्ट्स के आधार पर बताया है कि मानव शरीर में मौजूद 99% रोगाणुओं (माइक्रोब्स) के बारे में विज्ञान को कोई जानकारी नहीं है। शोधकर्ता स्टीफेन क्वेक ने बताया कि अध्ययन में उन्हें जो जानकारियां मिली हैं, उनमें से कई जानकारियां अलग और बिलकुल नई हैं।एमेज़ॉन के सीईओ जेफ बेज़ोस का दावा है कि एक दिन ऐसा आएगा जब अंतरिक्ष में एक खरब लोग रहेंगे। उन्हें उम्मीद है कि उनकी एरोस्पेस कंपनी ब्लू ओरिजिन दूसरे ग्रहों पर इंसानों को बसाने में मदद करेगी। हालांकि, उन्होंने माना कि इस मिशन में अभी काफी समय लगेगा और वह इसे देखने के लिए जीवित नहीं रहेंगे।जापानी वैज्ञानिकों ने पहली बार CRISPR/Cas9 जीन एडिटिंग तकनीक की मदद से फूल का रंग बैंगनी से सफेद कर दिया। इसके लिए वैज्ञानिकों ने फूल के एक जीन में बदलाव किए और इसकी सफलता दर 75% रही। इस तकनीक में डीएनए के एक हिस्से के दो सिरों को काट दिया जाता है, जिसकी मदद से डीएनए में बदलाव होता है।एक अध्ययन के मुताबिक, इंसानों द्वारा जैव विविधता और स्तनपायी प्रजातियों को पहुंचाई गई क्षति से उबरने में करीब 50 लाख वर्ष लगेंगे। बतौर शोधकर्ता, मनुष्यों के चलते स्तनपायी जीव बहुत तेज़ी से विलुप्त हो रहे हैं जबकि उनके विकास की दर काफी कम है। 50 वर्षों में काले गैंडे और एशियाई हाथी जैसी कई प्रजातियां विलुप्त हो सकती हैं।दिसंबर में रूसी रॉकेट सोयुज़ से दो यात्रियों के साथ इंटरनैशनल स्पेस स्टेशन (आईएसएस) जाने वाली अमेरिकी महिला

बीजिंग (चीन) का एक वीडियो सामने आया है जिसमें लोग कोविड-19 टेस्ट करवाने के लिए लाइन में खड़े दिख रहे हैं। लोगों को ज़रूरत पड़ने पर ही घर से बाहर निकलने की सलाह दी गई है। वहीं, 40 लाख की आबादी वाले शहर लानज़ू में लॉकडाउन लगा दिया गया है।फेडरल कोविड-19 सहायता राशि के आवेदन में झूठ बोलने और इन पैसों से $57,789 (₹43 लाख) में एक दुर्लभ पोकेमोन कार्ड खरीदने को लेकर एक शख्स पर धोखाधड़ी का आरोप तय हुआ है।

क्षेत्रों की परिस्थितियों में बदलाव ला सकता है।""यूएन ने अपनी 'स्टेट ऑफ दी क्लाइमेट इन एशिया 2020' रिपोर्ट में बताया है कि जलवायु संबंधी संकटों के कारण चीन को सालाना $238 अरब का नुकसान हुआ जो एशिया

नई रक्षा मंत्री बनाया गया जिनकी मां का जन्म पंजाब और पिता का तमिलनाडु में हुआ था। स्कॉलर, वकील और शोधकर्ता के रूप में काम कर चुकीं अनीता का जन्म केंटविले में हुआ था। अनीता ने ऑक्सफोर्ड यूनिवर्सिटी से जूरिसप्रूडेंस में बीए और टोरंटो यूनिवर्सिटी से मास्टर ऑफ लॉ किया।थाईलैंड में बहुमंज़िला इमारत की एक महिला निवासी द्वारा रस्सी काटने के बाद 2 पेंटर 26वीं मंज़िल के ऊपर लटके रहे। महिला ने काम को लेकर जानकारी नहीं देने पर ऐसा किया और बाद में पेंटर्स को बचा लिया गया। महिला पर हत्या के प्रयास का आरोप है और दोषी होने पर उसे 20-साल तक की जेल हो सकती है।जून-2020 में लंदन में एक पार्क में 2 बहनों की

""हम न केवल गलत रास्ते पर हैं बल्कि इस संकट के मुहाने पर खड़े हैं।"" उन्होंने कहा, ""राष्ट्रों के पास जलवायु परिवर्तन से निपटने के लिए विज्ञान, प्रौद्योगिकी और संसाधन हैं...मानवता को बचाने के लिए निर्णायक साहसिक निर्णय आवश्यक है।""दक्षिण कोरियाई जासूसी एजेंसी के अनुसार, उत्तर कोरिया के 37-वर्षीय नेता किम जोंग-उन ने करीब 20-किलोग्राम वज़न घटाया है और वह बॉडी डबल का इस्तेमाल नहीं कर रहे हैं। बकौल एजेंसी, 2019 में किम का वज़न लगभग 140-किलोग्राम था और तब से उन्होंने अपना वज़न कम किया। एजेंसी ने एक एचडी वीडियो के विश्लेषण के आधार पर यह अनुमान लगाया।कनाडाई प्रधानमंत्री जस्टिन ट्रूडो ने भारतीय मूल की अनीता आनंद को रक्षा मंत्री बनाया है। 54-वर्षीय अनीता भारतीय मूल के रक्षा मंत्री हरजीत सज्जन की जगह लेंगी और वह कनाडा की रक्षा मंत्री बनने वाली दूसरी महिला हैं। इससे पहले खरीद मंत्री के तौर पर कार्यरत अनीता ने कोविड-19 टीके खरीदने के लिए देश के प्रयासों का नेतृत्व किया था।ओमान सरकार ने भारत बायोटेक की 'कोवैक्‍सीन' को मान्‍यता प्राप्‍त कोविड-19 वैक्‍सीन्स की सूची में शामिल कर लिया है। ओमान

गाइडलाइंस का पालन करना होगा।रूस में बढ़ते कोविड-19 मामलों के बीच राजधानी मॉस्को में आंशिक लॉकडाउन लगाया गया है। इसके तहत मॉस्को में 28 अक्टूबर से 7 नवंबर के बीच सभी गैर-ज़रूरी सेवाएं बंद रहेंगी। गौरतलब है कि रूस में गुरुवार को कोविड-19 के 40,096 नए मामले सामने आए थे जबकि संक्रमित 1,159 लोगों की मौत हो गई थी।चीनी सरकार द्वारा कोविड-19 के बढ़ते मामलों के कारण लगाए गए ताज़ा प्रतिबंधों के बाद देश

और बिगड़ने का अनुमान जताया है।अमेरिका में 'जॉइंट चीफ्स ऑफ स्टाफ' के प्रमुख जनरल मार्क मिले ने कहा है कि चीनी सेना में 'तेज़ी से विस्तार' हो रहा है। उन्होंने कहा, ""चीन ने बेहद महत्वपूर्ण हाइपरसोनिक हथियार का परीक्षण किया...यह बड़ी चिंता का विषय है।"" हालांकि, चीन ने अगस्त में हाइपरसोनिक मिसाइल के परीक्षण से इनकार करते हुए कहा कि यह स्पेसक्राफ्ट का परीक्षण था।",शुभम गुप्ताशुभम गुप्ताGunjan

The plea added that, in April 2018, RBI issued a circular prohibiting all the banks to deal with any virtual currency or provide services for facilitating any person or entity in dealing with or settling them including Bitcoins.

प्लांट्स में अक्टूबर में सामान्य उत्पादन के मुकाबले 60% तक कम उत्पादन होने की संभावना है। चिप की कमी के कारण अगस्त 2021 में कंपनी का प्रोडक्शन 8% घटकर 1,13,937 यूनिट रहा है जबकि अगस्त, 2020 में यह आंकड़ा 1,23,769 यूनिट था।मारुति सुज़ुकी इंडिया के चेयरमैन आर.सी. भार्गव के अनुसार, जीएसटी और अधिग्रहण की ऊंची दरों के कारण भारत में कारों की मांग में सुस्ती है। उन्होंने कहा कि सरकारों द्वारा अधिग्रहण

प्रधानमंत्री व एलन मस्क के बीच बैठक का आग्रह किया है।कांग्रेस नेता शशि थरूर ने कहा है कि टेस्ला जैसे इलेक्ट्रिक कार निर्माताओं पर ऊंचे आयात शुल्क लगाने की बजाय उन्हें भारत में विनिर्माण के लिए इस शर्त के साथ बुलाना चाहिए कि वे वाहन के 60%-70% पार्ट्स भारतीय उद्योगों से खरीदें। गौरतलब है कि एलन मस्क ने ट्वीट किया था कि भारत में आयात शुल्क बहुत अधिक है।",रुचिका सैनीरुचिका सैनीमोनिका शर्मामोनिका

Large mammal species such as the Asian elephant are disproportionately at risk. File photoWhile Earth has experienced five mass extinctions in its history, the current phenomenon is unique in that it is caused by humans, not natural disasters.In the new study, researchers from Aarhus University and the University of Gothenburg used an extensive database of mammals both in existence today and those that have gone extinct since the rise of Homo sapiens to assess the future of mammalian biodiversity.Large mammal species, the researchers warn, are disproportionately at risk of dying out altogether.‘Large mammals, or megafauna, such as giant sloths and saber-toothed tigers, which became extinct about 10,000 years ago, were highly evolutionarily distinct,’ says palaeontologist Matt Davis from Aarhus University, who led the study.‘Since they had few close relatives, their extinctions meant that entire branches of Earth’s evolutionary tree were chopped off,' Davis says.‘There were hundreds of species of shrew, so they can weather a few extinctions. There were only four species of saber-toothed tiger; they all went extinct.’Worrying new estimates suggest it will take upwards of 5 million years for mammal species to bounce back to current biodiversity level following the extinctions expected to occur over the next five decadesAccording to the study, it will take mammals 5 to 7 million years to recover from the biodiversity losses they have incurred since the emergence of modern humans.And, it would take 3 to 5 million years to reach the levels they’re at now, even if humans cease destructive practices.In the next 50 years, we could lose several species, with the black rhino and Asian elephant both feared to be at risk of dying out before the end of the century.Traditionally, scientists have referred to the 'Big Five' mass extinctions, including perhaps the most famous mass extinction triggered by a meteorite impact that brought about the end of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. But the other major mass extinctions were caused by phenomena originating entirely on Earth, and while they are less well known, we may learn something from exploring them that could shed light on our current environmental crises.‘Although we once lived in a world of giants: giant beavers, giant armadillos, giant deer, etc, we now live in a world that is becoming increasingly impoverished of large wild mammalian species,’ says says Professor Jens-Christian Svenning from Aarhus University, who heads a large research program on megafauna.‘The few remaining giants, such as rhinos and elephants, are in danger of being wiped out very rapidly.’The researchers say the data could be used to identify and prioritize at risk species before it’s too late.‘It is much easier to save biodiversity now than to re-evolve it later,’ Davis says. The comments below have not been moderated.We are no longer accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday &amp; Metro Media Group",True,"Humans are now driving mammals to extinction at rates much faster than Earth’s species may be able to recover from, a new study warns.Even in the best-case scenario, worrying new estimates suggest it will take upwards of 5 million years for mammal species to bounce back to current biodiversity levels following the extinctions expected to occur over the next five decades.The researchers say evolution will not be able to keep up with the rate by which mammal species are dying out unless we ramp up conservation efforts.

This makes it the only major extinction to be linked to global cooling. The Late Devonian: This period is now regarded as a number of 'pulses' of extinction spread over 20m years, beginning 380m years ago. This extinction has been linked to major climate change, possibly caused by an eruption of the volcanic Viluy Traps area in modern-day Siberia. A major eruption might have caused rapid fluctations in sea levels and reduced oxygen levels in the oceans.The Middle Permian:  Scientists have recently discovered another event 262m years ago that rivals the 'Big Five' in size. This event coincided with the Emeishan eruption in what's now China, and is known to have caused simultaneous extinctions in the tropics and higher latitudes.The Late Permian: The Late Permian mass extinction around 252m years ago dwarfs all the other events, with about 96% of species becoming extinct. The extinction was triggered by a vast eruption of the Siberian Traps, a gigantic and prolonged volcanic event that covered much of modern day Siberia, which led to a cascade of environmental effects.The Late Triassic: The Late Triassic event, 201m years ago, shares a number of similarities with the Late Permian event. It was caused by another large-scale eruption, this time of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which heralded the splitting of the supercontinent Pangaea and the initial opening of what would later become the Atlantic Ocean.adverts.addToArray({""pos"":""mpu_factbox""})Advertisement‘Although we once lived in a world of giants: giant beavers, giant armadillos, giant deer, etc, we now live in a world that is becoming increasingly impoverished of large wild mammalian species,’ says says Professor Jens-Christian Svenning from Aarhus University, who heads a large research program on megafauna.‘The few remaining giants, such as rhinos and elephants, are in danger of being wiped out very rapidly.’The researchers say the data could be used to identify and prioritize at risk species before it’s too late.‘It is much easier to save biodiversity now than to re-evolve it later,’ Davis says.        ",Cheyenne Macdonald For Dailymail.com,, Daily Mail Online
