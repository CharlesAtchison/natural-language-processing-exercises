The defence lawyer was not available for comments.“In August 2014, the woman, who lost her husband in 2011, filed a complaint that she was gang-raped by four people who lived in her neighbourhood. Police arrested the accused after lodging the FIR under section 376 D. The medical report of the woman confirmed rape and her clothes and vaginal swab were taken for further investigation,” Qureshi said.The accused, however, insisted they were innocent and approached senior Ashok Nagar police officer to seek a DNA test to establish the truth.“The test report revealed that the woman was not raped by any of the four but by some other person,” the prosecutor said. At their request, the police also took samples of the son-in-law.“Gopal Rajak’s sample matched with the sperm samples collected from the woman’s clothes.” Gopal Rajak was arrested.“During interrogation, Gopal Rajak confessed that he was in a relationship with Guddi and they filed a false case to implicate their neighbours, who used to fight with Guddi and Gopal on trivial issues,” police officer VP Singh Jat, who investigated the case, said.“It was a serious case as the woman alleged that the four accused barged into her house and raped her in the night,” said the police officer, recalling how the closely-watched case in the district by politicians and activists took a stunning turn.“During investigations, we also found many witnesses who said the four accused were not present at the same place together but it was DNA test which conclusively exposed the fraud…. We are happy that we succeed in punishing the woman and the man for abusing the law,” VP Singh Jat said.Victory of ‘new India’, health workers: Reddy on 1BN dosesKarnataka school shut after 33 students test Covid positiveRow over absence of Kannada banners at Karnataka govt conferenceKarnataka high court restrains police action against Dream 11 foundersThis site and its partners use technology such as cookies to personalize content and ads and analyse traffic.

Rallying crude and the resultant fear of the current account deficit have seen the rupee going down from 73.09 on September 1 to a low of 75.52 to a dollar on October 12. But it has again started appreciating and is presently at around 75, visible from forex market turnover -USD 2.2 billion of excess dollar supply in August - clearly showing the appreciating bias on the rupee.  Also Read | 1 TB Internal Phone Memory! Samsung Ready With World's First 1TB Chip for Smartphones.                    The Reserve Bank has been continuously making forex purchases, and in FY21, it bought Rs 5.1 lakh crore worth of forex and the forex reserves swelled by USD 103.72 billion. Despite the second wave, the rupee gained strength and even went below 73 to a dollar, SBI Research said on Thursday in its report.                    Taking everything into account -- robust FDI inflows amid some volatility in FPI inflows of late -- our CAD projections stand at 1.4 per cent of GDP for the full year, which is comfortable, and if there is no extremely devastating third wave, the rupee is going to handle any taper news with relative calm, the report noted.  Also Read | 10-0! Jose Mourinho Starts AS Roma Managerial Career in Style by Defeating Serie D Side Montecatini.                    Considering higher domestic inflation, as supply disruptions mount, it will not do any harm for the RBI to lean with the wind and let the rupee appreciate, as it can lead to reduced imported inflation when metal and oil prices are rising, and clearing the liquidity overhang to some extent, it added.                    This is more so since our backward linkages in the global value chains is higher than forward linkage and a weak rupee may not help in pushing the exports as much as is touted by traditional economic theory, the report said.                    The report also said that the RBI has been globally applauded for its effective exchange rate management. The IMF in its recently released article IV consultation welcomed the authorities' commitment to maintain exchange rate flexibility.                    Noting that wholesale price inflation has averaged at 11.6 per cent in H1 of FY22, and CPI at 5.34 per cent, the report said since the onset of the pandemic in 2020, consumer price and wholesale price inflation rates have been exhibiting considerable divergence.                    Such developments miss the concerns of manufacturers who are grappling with extremely high imported inflation and a falling rupee just adding to their woes, it added.                    The current rally in oil prices due to a global supply shortage and strong demand as the world recovers from the pandemic is reminiscent of the early 2010s when oil was way above USD 100 a barrel.                    The current account deficit, which had touched a high of 4.82 per cent of GDP in FY13, started declining and has not gone above 2.1 per cent since then.                    However, the rising crude prices and overall supply-side bottlenecks due to the pandemic are raising concerns again and between May and September 2013 the rupee lost as much as Rs 14 a dollar.                    September 2021 merchandise trade deficit at USD 22.59 billion is quite high and has the closest counterpart in October 2012 when it was USD 20.21 billion.                    So far exports have been doing quite well with merchandise exports in H1 of 2021, touching USD 197.9 billion, a robust increase of 24.3 per cent over USD 159.2 billion in H1 of 2019.                    Thus, achieving the target of USD 400 billion is not a pipe dream and this will provide a strong cushion to the current account balance, even if the oil import bills rise rapidly, the report said.(This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)© Latestly.com, 2021",True,,PTI,

The veteran, who’s working as Pakistan’s batting consultant in the T20 World Cup 2021, said that the Indian batters were taken aback by Afridi’s pace after they faced military medium pace during the IPL.On Sunday, October 24, Afridi ran through Team India’s top-order after he got rid of Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul in his opening spell. Then he came back to dismiss Virat Kohli, who scored a half-century. The Men in Green won the match by 10 wickets and Afridi got the Player of the Match award for his stupendous display of bowling at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.“The Indian batters had been facing 130 kph deliveries for the last month during the IPL. It’s a different cup of tea when you are facing someone running and bowling at Shaheen Shah Afridi’s pace,” Hayden was quoted as saying in Pak Passion.Hayden was also amazed to see a great amount of brotherhood between players of the two teams. Even as the scenario outside got heated up, the players showed sportsmanspirit on the ground. Kohli and MS Dhoni, Team India’s mentor, were seen having a chat with the Pakistan cricketers after the end of the match.“The thing that inspired me the most out of the performance was the fantastic sporting brotherhood,” Hayden had said.“That’s the role of sport, so it’s beautiful to see those moments where MS Dhoni is holding court with a few of the (Pakistan) players and Virat Kohli and (Rizwan), you know, in brotherhood, joining hands after there was heated battles in the middle,” he added.Hayden, in the meantime, was appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board after head coach Misbah-ul-Haq and bowling coach Waqar Younis stepped down from their respective positions. South Africa’s Vernon Philander was roped in as Pakistan’s bowling consultant.Having beaten India and New Zealand, Pakistan are sitting on top of the table in their group.

The HC said that Agarwal wasn't personally dealing with the transaction and thus cannot be accused of cheating.A bench of Justice Sandeep Shinde was hearing a plea filed by Agarwal through senior counsel Shirish Gupte, challenging the criminal process issued against him under charges of cheating by a Magistrate Court in August.The Magistrate court had issued process against Agarwal and a Bangalore-based firm on a complaint filed by advocate Amritpal Singh Khalsa, who claimed that he had ordered a hard disk for Rs 3,999 on Amazon, which was to be delivered by a Bangalore seller.However, when he tracked the order, he found that it was sent to Pimpri Chinchwad, Pune. Later, it was sent to a godown in Rajkot. He demanded a refund and alleged that he was denied the same.Accordingly, the magistrate, after scrutinising the material on record and a police report, initiated criminal proceedings against Agarwal under cheating and fraud.Disputing the issue, senior counsel Gupte argued that the complaint doesn't make out a case of cheating or fraud. He argued that his client wasn't involved in the day-to-day operations of the e-commerce giant.""The magistrate failed to consider that Amazon is not the seller or manufacturer of the product. It is merely an online marketplace, thereby it is entitled to protection under Section 79 of Information Technology, 2021 (as intermediary),"" Gupte argued.Having considered the contentions, Justice Shinde said, “The allegations do not constitute an offence of cheating, nor the allegations disclosed the fraudulent intention of Agarwal, when Khalsa placed an order of the product in question. The company and its head being a mere facilitator, Khalsa’s allegations that he was induced to buy a product with intention to cheat him, is wholly absent.”“There is no material on record to even suggest that the company had a direct involvement and inducing Khalsa to place an order with intention, not to deliver it, even after receiving the consideration for the same. Thus, neither the complaint, nor inquiry report submitted by the Investigating Officer constitute the offence of cheating against the company or Agarwal,” the judge held, while quashing the proceedings.(To receive our E-paper on whatsapp daily, please click here.

With a modern fleet, dedicated employees, and a stronger economic environment we are well-positioned to leverage all the growth opportunities around us,"" Dutta said.InterGlobe Aviation, the operator of IndiGo, India's largest airline in terms of market share, today reported a net loss of Rs 1,435.7 crore for July-Sept quarter, showing a steady decline in loss as compared to Rs 3,179 crore in Q1 FY22.IndiGo's EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortisation, and restructuring) for Q2 FY22 stood at Rs 340.8 crore, with the margin of 6.1 percent vs Rs 408.5 crore and 14.9 percent during the same period last year.For the quarter, IndiGo's passenger ticket revenues stood at Rs 4,716.3 crore, recording an increase of 113.6 percent. The ancillary revenues were Rs 817.7 crore, an increase of 61.4 percent compared to the same period last year. The company's total expenses for the September quarter also rose 71.3 percent YoY to Rs 7,234.4 crore.IndiGo's average daily revenue booked in October was equal to that of January 2020, just before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, while the airline was operating with a passenger load factor of above 70 percent in October, Dutta said.He added that rising input costs, especially of crude oil continue to remain a cause for concern for airlines in India and that the Ministry of Civil Aviation needs to work with state government to reduce tax on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF).""All airlines have shown the ministry how out of line the indirect taxes are in India. We are a heavily taxed industry. We are hopeful that bigger states will also reduce VAT on ATF,"" Dutta said.Furthermore, he said that IndiGo has requested the MoCA to remove fare caps completely and let airlines compete in an open market.IndiGo's Chief Strategy &amp;Revenue Officer Sanjay Kumar said that lot of corporates are travelling for conferences, corporate travel is coming back.He added that IndiGo has seen a 50% recovery in corporate travel and said that he hopes corporate travel gains momentum post-Diwali.When asked about the launch of upcoming ultra-low-cost carrier Akasa Air backed by investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Dutta said that while companies can plan to operate at very low costs but in reality, it's difficult to have a lower cost structure than IndiGo.He said that IndiGo operates at maximum seat density in its flights and that it already has unbundled to the extent regulation in India permit, thereby making IndiGo's cost structure very low.On the sale of Air India to the Tata Group, Dutta said that he expects Air India to operate like a full service carrier and is likely to focus on international markets for its revenues.",True,,,

He added he is looking for a fresh start in the Indian Premier League. The player recently disclosed that he is going to put his name up for auction ahead of next season. The left-hander verified the same while speaking on SEN Radio on Thursday. He mentioned that the SRH team management has still not communicated the reason for dropping him from their side in IPL 2021.He reckoned that looking at how things went last season; it is unlikely that the Hyderabad-based franchise will retain him for future editions of IPL. Here's what he said:the southpaw has contributed significantly towards the success of SRH both as a captain as well as a player. However, his latest stint has been deemed lackluster by many. The champion cricket also lost the team's captaincy after the side's slow start to the first half of the IPL 2021.Warner also failed to retain his position in the playing eleven after failing to make an impact in SRH's initial matches of the UAE leg.

Courtesy Facebook/via REUTERSOct 28 (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) is now called Meta, the company said on Thursday, in a rebrand that focuses on its ambitions building the ""metaverse,"" a shared virtual environment that it bets will be the next big computing platform.The rebrand comes as the world's largest social media  company battles criticisms from lawmakers and regulators over its market power, algorithmic decisions and the policing of abuses on its platforms.CEO Mark Zuckerberg, speaking at the company's live-streamed virtual and augmented reality conference, said the new name reflected its ambitions to build the metaverse, rather than its namesake social media service.The metaverse, a term first coined in a dystopian novel three decades ago and now attracting buzz in Silicon Valley, refers broadly to the idea of a shared virtual environment which can be accessed by people using different devices.""Right now, our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can't possibly represent everything that we're doing today, let alone in the future,"" said Zuckerberg.The company, which has invested heavily in augmented and virtual reality, said the change would bring together its different apps and technologies under one new brand. It said it would not change its corporate structure.The tech giant, which reports about 2.9 billion monthly users, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years from global lawmakers and regulators.In the latest controversy, whistleblower and former Facebook employee Frances Haugen leaked documents which she said showed the company chose profit over user safety. Zuckerberg earlier this week said the documents were being used to paint a ""false picture.""The company said in a blog post that it intends to start trading  under the new stock ticker it has reserved, MVRS, on Dec. 1. On Thursday, it unveiled a new sign at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, replacing its thumbs-up ""Like"" logo with a blue infinity shape.Facebook said this week that its hardware division Facebook Reality Labs, which is responsible for AR and VR efforts, would become a separate reporting unit and that its investment in it would reduce this year's total operating profit by about $10 billion. The unit will now be called Reality Labs, its head Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth tweeted on Thursday.Zuckerberg said the new name also reflects that over time, users will not need to use Facebook to use the company's other services.This year, the company created a product team focused on the metaverse and it recently announced plans to hire 10,000 employees in Europe over the next five years to work on the effort.Facebook shares were up 3.7% at $323.81 on Thursday afternoon.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Subscribe for our daily curated newsletter to receive the latest exclusive Reuters coverage delivered to your inbox.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Talking about the teaser, he said, “The phrase ‘a dream come true’ gets thrown around a lot, but I have never meant it more in my life. Anyone who knows me knows that my love for animate films runs deep. I can’t believe that I get to be a part of the Pixar family and work with these truly brilliant artists who tell stories unlike anyone else. Watching them work is nothing short of magic. I pinch myself every day.” While the film is an original story that exists outside the Toy Story universe, the teaser has some elements that connect them. The iconic green-and-white spacesuit is seen, Lightyear smirking at it with an ambitious glint in his eyes. There is also the catchphrase, cut off by the teaser ending, something that Pixar seems to have borrowed from Chris Evans’s stint as Captain America.Lightyear is the origin story of Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger toy that audiences know and love from the Toy Story franchise. This film follows Lightyear, the pilot, on a sci-fi adventure to infinity and beyond, showing us the story behind the legend. The film is directed by Annie award-winning director and experienced Pixar animator Angus MacLane (Finding Dory).

They have a unique voice of their own – something they plan to nurture further with their production house, Pushing Buttons Studios. They talk about their wedding plans, being opinionated actors in a polarized environment and the need to champion one another in the film industry today.Edited excerpts:Anupama Chopra: Since the wedding question is the first thing everybody wants to know – where are we at?Ali Fazal: It’s been a topsy-turvy year for everybody, that’s why all our celebrations got stalled. We’re hoping for things to improve in the new year. We were planning [the wedding] around the time the second wave came. Then it happened and we couldn’t go ahead with it. Now, we are looking at February-March 2022.AC: Tell me about your production house, Pushing Buttons Studios. What buttons are the two of you planning to push?Richa Chadha: It can mean many things. It can be like the old-style typewriters, where you push the keys and it creates the sounds.AF: There are so many kinds of buttons all over the world. They join fabrics together. And pushing buttons is sometimes required, for example, artistes keep thinking that someone needs to challenge them in order to bring out their best version.We wanted to create a medium for artistes to come to us and not be stuck. That was my biggest problem when I was new – you used to go somewhere and get stuck. The creativity was defined for you before you could grow wings. I thought that’s something people needed. So, I tell writers to come and collaborate with us and then move. If you have to grow, you go. There’s no point living in a box.RC: It’s not to say that we are extremely established stars. We aren’t delusional about that. But I trust his aesthetic and instinct. As actors, you very often put out stuff in the world that maybe you wouldn’t even watch. They have different reasons for signing a film – sometimes, it’s the money, sometimes, it’s the banner etc. At least in my case, there’s such a disconnect between who I am, the stuff that I wanted to do and the present that I wanted to tell stories that made sense to me. It’s more than just us starting this together. It’s about gathering like-minded people to make good films.AC: What are the rules of engagement for a couple that also works together? Apart from the production house, you’ll do Fukrey 3, you did the Spotify show, Virus 2062. Richa, you’ve mentioned that it’s an egalitarian household where all chores are equally divided. But how does the work work?RC: We haven’t had the chance to do that very often.AF: In Fukrey, our characters aren’t interacting at all. But I must say, the jamming sessions that we do on our own are my source of enjoyment in this relationship. I love it. That’s why I keep saying that I’d love to work with her and find the right script. Virus was two days of studio work, so we just had fun. We did some rehearsals because acting with the voice is a new medium we were trying to explore. I’m very excited when I jam with her when she’s writing. She’s onto something brilliant.AC: What are you writing?RC: I have the first draft of a screenplay that I have written, which I want to act in. It’s a very subversive film about the pressure on women to get married if they’re between 25-30, and what happens each year onwards. It’s a comedy in a surreal space.AC: Right now, it’s a hard time to be actors with opinions. It’s a hard time to be in an inter-faith relationship. How are you doing? Does the shrillness ever get to you?RC: It’s not like we have a huge friends circle in the industry. I think the crass roles that I have done, like Bholi (in Fukrey), are stuck in people’s minds because that’s my most commercial work so far. On top of that, I’m voicing my opinions on Twitter. When people meet me, be it the audience or the filmmakers, they tell me, ‘Oh, you are so soft spoken and kind.’ Then I say, ‘Yeah, what did you expect?’ So, people can’t exactly differentiate between the actor and the character. I’ve tried to temper down in terms of my opinions but my opinions and ideology is very evident. I don’t think anyone can change that nor should it change. If you bend to that fear, you’re not being authentic.As artistes, we feel everything. We are doomed to feel perhaps more viscerally than others. There are days when I feel like an open wound. Forget everything else, but I want people to realise that in any kind of battle for ‘democracy,’ the key thing is freedom of expression. It’s a battle of culture. The only difference between a totalitarian state and a state that allows free speech is culture. So, what can we do, as artistes, to build a culture where we talk about todo nahi, jodo (don’t break, combine)? We need to create a society where division doesn’t work.Also Read: Adarsh Gourav And Ali Fazal On Life After International AcclaimAC: Ali, about your career abroad, you’ve talked about how you just did these auditions and sent in your phone auditions. And here you are, where I’m watching the promo of Death On The Nile. There’s Kenneth Branagh, Annette Bening, Gal Gadot and Ali Fazal in the middle of that. What are the lessons you bring home from these excursions into these amazing movies?AF: There’s space for everybody in this world. I think something that I’ve learnt watching films not only from there but from the South too, is that here, we need to learn how to champion each other. We don’t do that. That’s what’s most important. We need to not worry about the game. That’s what I learnt there [from international projects]. When I was on set, it was all about ‘What are you bringing in to the table?’RC: I had written a blog about this semi-sadist approach. Maybe we’re naïve to think that it doesn’t happen elsewhere, but I’ve seen it here. It’s like, ‘Oh, their film flopped. That’s good!’AF: Things are changing now. The canvas got bigger in the last two years. There’s a lot of international stuff happening that requires a lot of Indian talent as well. It’s amazing how so many of us have moved that side. Recently, Kubra [Sait] did something in Foundation, Adarsh [Gourav] is doing some lovely work.RC: These are achievements of the industry and we must celebrate them together. I get very happy when I see Jaideep Ahlawat (who I worked with in Gangs Of Wasseypur) shoot to stardom post Paatal Lok, when I see Pratik Gandhi, after decades of struggle, doing Scam 1992. I feel really happy that there’s new, emerging talent. I would really hope that people learn a lesson and understand that somebody else’s growth doesn’t mean your own diminution. That’s a way of the past. I feel a pang of jealousy when I look at black and white pictures of Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar and Dev Anand casually playing the tabla, singing, etc. That camaraderie and the feeling of fraternity needs to come back.Anupama Chopra is a film critic, television anchor and book author.

These tasks — common crew activities — can be used in a general-purpose way for a range of in-space activities. The successful demo raised what NASA calls the “technology readiness level” of the Gitai robot to TRL 7. There are nine TRLs in total and hitting all of them will be critical for Gitai commercializing its robots.The demonstration was performed inside space company Nanoracks’ Bishop Airlock, the world’s first (and only) commercial airlock to be attached to the exterior of the station. Nanoracks — which announced plans last week to launch a fully private commercial space station with Voyage Space and Lockheed Martin — also furnished on-orbit operations, data downlink and the launch opportunity.Gitai’s robotic arm was sent to orbit aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, part of the launch company’s 23rd Commercial Resupply Services Mission at the end of August. The Japanese startup is developing robots for a range of general purposes in space, including on-orbit servicing of spacecraft, construction or manufacturing tasks. The next step for the company is to test the Gitai robot outside the ISS.“The success of this investigation proves that the GITAI robot can be a solution for space agencies and commercial space companies looking for versatile, dexterous, relatively safe (less exposure to life threatening risks for humans) and inexpensive labor force,” NASA said in a tech demo update. “Providing this option furthers the goals of commercialization of space.”Gitai doesn’t want to just build robotic arms, however. The company’s long-term vision sees robots as key tools for building space colonies on the surface of the moon or even Mars. This robotic workforce could be the answer to accelerating human presence in off-world environments. Earlier this year, the startup closed a $17.1 million Series B funding round, to hire and accelerate the development of a separate satellite servicing tech demo set to take place in 2023.Watch footage from last week’s demonstration here:{{{author}}}{{{date}}}",True,,,

They are champions and they have a proven track record,"" the managing director of Bajaj Auto Ltd. said in a media conference held to announce the launch of the new Pulsar motorbike.Here are Bajaj's comments in brief;""The sign of a champion in the auto industry is that you are able to adapt.This (Bajaj) is a 75-year-old company and it has adapted to challenges over and over again.Sometimes the challenge was of moving from scooters to motorcycles, sometimes it was regulations, competition or sometimes it is the electric disruption.Good Indian two-wheeler companies are not as light-weight as some startups would like to think.The question is who are you going to bet on, are you going to bet on the legacy companies or you are going to bet on startups?I’m going to bet on BET — Bajaj, (Royal) Enfield and TVS. They are champions and they have a proven track record.""Taking a jibe at Ola, Ather, Tork Motors and SmartE, all startups that have entered the electric scooter segment, Bajaj said the legacy companies eat OATS for breakfast.The EV startup business model is a cash-burn model and our business model is cash-flow model, Bajaj said. ""We (legacy players) have to make sure we make money when we make a motorcycle.If we launch a motorcycle in October, you will get it in November. It is not that we will launch in 2021 you will get it in 2022, that’s the startup way, and not the legacy way.There are startups out there that we respect and the biggest one is Ola but we have to still see them produce something and sell something.There is Ather we enormously respect and they have demonstrated.""Bajaj Auto's Chetak — the electric version of its classic scooter brand — was launched in 2019. It marked the return of the company to scooters, a segment it dominated once but exited when Rajiv took over the reins from his father. The Chetak competes with electric scooters from other two-wheeler companies like TVS Motor Co. and Hero Electric Ltd. — run by a branch of the same family that owns and runs India's largest two-wheeler company Hero MotoCorp Ltd.But the more aggressive competitors have been new entrants such as Ather Energy—backed by Hero MotoCorp—and Ola Electric, a subsidiary of the popular ride-share company.Ola Electric Mobility Pvt. launched its electric scooter in August this year, while aggressively raising funds at a $3-billion valuation. In the first two days of accepting bookings, the company clocked sales of more than Rs 1,000 crore. Production has started and deliveries will begin towards the year-end.

Wyden insists the billionaires’ tax plan isn’t dead, but talks have instead moved on to a possible 3% surcharge -- on top of the highest income tax rate -- for those earning more than $10 million.Read more: Democrats Clash on Billionaire Tax as Neal Rejects Senate PlanWhile such a plan would draw in a larger number of taxpayers than the billionaires’ tax and help pay for a Democratic social-spending plan that could approach $2 trillion, it would take a far smaller bite from the wealthiest Americans, such as Musk and Bezos.Under the billionaires’ tax proposal, Musk and Bezos collectively would have been hit with a $100 billion one-time tax bill, payable over five years, if the proposal had been approved, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The plan explicitly targeted appreciated public shareholdings, which have been a main driver of billionaires’ steep wealth gains in recent years.Musk, co-founder of publicly traded Tesla and closely held rocket company SpaceX, has added $122.3 billion to his fortune this year, pushing his net worth to $292 billion, according to the Bloomberg index. Amazon.com Inc. founder Bezos is worth $196.3 billion.The 10 richest Americans, including Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, are worth a total of $1.4 trillion, according to the index.Musk was dismissive of Wyden’s plan, saying taxing billionaires would only make a “small dent” toward paying off the U.S. national debt. “Spending is the real problem,” Musk said in a tweet that also included a link to an online clock that estimates the country’s debt. Even if the super-wealthy were taxed at “100%,” the government would need to turn to the “general public” in order to make for the short-fall, the Tesla Chief Executive said. “This is basic math,” he said.Musk’s wealth has ballooned partly because he hasn’t sold any of his Tesla stock for years, instead tapping banks for loans using his stake in the electric-vehicle maker as collateral. Pledging shares is a way to monetize equity without actually selling it. Musk has $515 million in personal loans from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp., according to a regulatory filing from December 2020, the most recent one available with this information. Musk has also said some of his shares in SpaceX are pledged, but hasn’t disclosed details about how many.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",True,,,

REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannOct 27 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc (UBER.N) on Wednesday said it is launching a new partnership with rental car company Hertz  to offer 50,000 Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) vehicles as a rental option for its ride-hail drivers by 2023.Uber drivers can rent a Tesla through Hertz starting on Nov. 1 in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington DC, with the program later this year expanding to cities nationwide, the ride-hail company said in a blog post.The announcement comes after Hertz on Monday said it would order 100,000 Tesla vehicles by the end of 2022, meaning that half of the rental company's Tesla fleet would be reserved exclusively for Uber drivers.News of the biggest-ever Tesla order led to a share price rally and saw the electric vehicle company's market value surpass $1 trillion on Monday.  read more Tesla shares on Wednesday were up 3%, while Uber shares were down 1.4%. Hertz shares were up 2%.Hertz on Wednesday also announced a separate partnership with online used-car dealer Carvana Co (CVNA.N), whose shares rose 3% in morning trade. Under the agreement, Hertz would reduce its reliance on mass auctions to offload used rental fleet vehicles and instead sell vehicles directly to consumers through Carvana's sales channels. For Uber drivers, Tesla rentals will start out at $334 a week, including insurance and maintenance, and consist mostly of the company's Model 3 sedan. Uber said the rental cost would drop to $299 per week or lower as the program expands in the coming year.Wednesday's deal represents Uber's most significant step so far in expanding the use of EVs on its platform. The company has vowed to operate only electric vehicles on its United States, Canadian and European platform by 2030, and worldwide by 2040.But only a few ride-hail drivers can afford the higher EV sticker prices and in 2019, only 0.15% of all Uber miles in the United States and Canada were driven in electric vehicles, company data showed.Ride-hail drivers produce more pollution per passenger mile traveled because they spend more than a third of their time driving around empty. Researchers generally assume that electrifying one ride-hail vehicle reduces the same amount of CO2 as converting three regular gas-powered vehicles.  read more Hertz, which is emerging from bankruptcy, hopes the EV focus will allow the once-dominant brand to stand out against competitors.Carmakers also consider partnerships with ride-hail companies as a convenient way to expose more consumers to non-fuel-powered vehicles.

Indeed, during the same shareholder meeting, Musk, who had personally moved to Texas last year, said that the company hopes to increase output at its Fremont facility in the Bay Area by 50%.“I don’t think anybody knows exactly what it means that he’s moving his headquarters,” Myers said. “From the perspective of California, they’re not going anywhere.”Tesla has yet to move to Austin from its Palo Alto base.

Meanwhile, other platforms such as Mobile Premier League, Junglee Games, Adda52 and Games24x7-owned My11Circle have placed geoblocking restrictions on users within the state.Karnataka High Court is also hearing petitions filed by skill gaming industry body All India Gaming Federation and real-money gaming firms such as Mobile Premier League (MPL), Games24x7, A23(Ace2Three), Junglee Games, Gameskraft and Pacific Games. These petitions challenge the constitutional validity of amendments made to the Karnataka Police (Amendment) Act.Advocate Arvind P Datar, appearing for All India Gaming Federation, had argued that Karnataka's recent amendment makes no distinction between the game of chance and game of skill. However, the government had submitted to the high court the law was aimed at saving the youngsters from gaming addiction and falling into deep debts.On October 22, a single-judge bench of Justice Krishna S Dixit had told the Advocate General appearing on behalf of the state government not to make any arrests under the new law.",True,,,

This mission is going to change India: IPO-bound Paytm's Vijay Shekhar Sharma,"Legend has it that the Paytm headquarters in Noida has a poster that says- Go Big or Go Home. Go Big is what Paytm founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma is about to do, as the company he founded over 2 decades ago gets ready for the biggest IPO in India's history.The payments and financial services player is preparing for an Rs 18,300 crore initial public offering (IPO) that will open for subscription between November 8 and 10, 2021 at a price band of Rs 2,080- Rs 2,150, This is India’s largest market debut, a record that was previously held by Coal India, which raised Rs 15,000 crore over a decade ago.The $20 billion IPO is a huge milestone and vindication for Sharma, who hails from a village named Harduaganj near Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh.Founded in 2000, One97, the parent company of Paytm spent almost a decade catering to the mobile VAS (value-added services) market. It made its first pivot with the launch of a mobile recharge platform in 2010 and today has an ecosystem that spans payments, credit, insurance, merchants, wealth management, and e-commerce services.In this interview with Moneycontrol, Sharma and Paytm's President and Group CFO Madhur Deora spoke about why they decided to go public, monetization plans, the path to profitability, competition, and what the IPO means for India.Edited Excerpts:It's been a long 21-year journey for you- from VAS to becoming India's leading fintech player. Now you are launching India's biggest IPO. What finally made you go public? Was it to give investors an exit- considering 10,000 crores from this issue is an offer for sale by existing shareholders? Vijay: There is a tremendous amount of work that goes into running a company and this kind of milestone where we can take this to mass investors, where we can go for an IPO is incredible. I never thought it would happen so fast. The pandemic accelerated every journey- swing from consumer to merchant mindset to readiness for an IPO. It is better for us to become an India-listed entity and India story instead of waiting for a foreign listing. We took a decision to list in India, and if in India, how about doing it now? Surprisingly, our IPO process started in the month of April, we had much less time to prepare. But the company, maturity, and scale have been tremendously good.You already have one of the highest user numbers in India- 337 million users and over 21 million merchants. Will you now use the IPO proceeds for more customer acquisition or to monetize this user base- by cross-selling credit, insurance, wealth advisory, etc? Vijay: Our ambition is half a billion Indians- that is our holy grail. The user base will be headed towards that as a milestone. We believe that consumers, merchants, and customers on our platform have the opportunity to generate revenues and profits for the platform. Not all 500 million will be revenue or profit-worthy. Our obligation and success will be benchmarked by how many people we bring on financial services, to how many people we bring to the mainstream of the economy. We will continue to invest and acquire customers.At Rs 18,300 crore, India Inc’s Biggest IPO By Paytm May Launch Between November 8 to 10 Vijay, one thing that we see is that Paytm is so diverse and vast today- where will its biggest sources of revenue come from? If you have to simplify and break down your business and revenue model to a retail investor- what would you say to them?Vijay: The primary story of Paytm is payments. It is our core moat where we acquire consumers and merchants. And then we offer financial services with our partners. Payments, commerce, financial services - that is our stack. Every line item of that is a large business by itself. We don't have to spend CAC(customer acquisition cost) to buy everything- if a customer comes for payment, he or she can become eligible for credit, they may book a bus ticket. I would say a large number of customers converted as user of financial services or commerce makes all the revenue and we believe more and more customers will mature towards this. It is easy to understand the model- payment is a customer acquiring and retention moat, there is commerce and financial services. The best way to look at it is how many customers, how much of revenue and what is the contribution margin- it means the company is able to monetize per customer better.How have your newer initiatives such as broking and lending played out? Vijay: The most important financial service vertical and company vertical that we launched during the lockdown was credit - where the customers and merchants were offered credit from our financial institution partners. A credit product we created, Paytm postpaid is popular. The number of customers is so small that we can see a 100 percent growth year on year. Credit as a need for this country is an important thing. RBI in 2020 brought a guideline that made this business model more kosher. Credit is a huge opportunity. By partnering with banks and NBFCs, we believe we will be able to amplify this opportunity.Paytm, Mobikwik, Nykaa and others to list soon: Here’s how retail investors can pick the right IPOsThe payment acceptance is still in the early stages. We have a lot more equipment coming after QR Code, sound box and POS device. That will be our next focus.What are your plans with regards to a small finance bank license? You spoke about how you will be partnering only with the banks. Is that why you're not applying for an NBFC license?Vijay: The plan is very very clear. We will not apply for an NBFC license. We would remain focused on partnering with financial institutions just because RBI hasn't even clarified it as a business model.As far as Paytm Payment Bank is concerned, it has its own journey. Potentially on the day when RBI permits it could apply for Paytm small finance bank license and that is logical to do because there would be many other products we would be able to distribute because of that.Paytm's plan is not contingent or changing on the basis of payment bank becoming a small finance bank.In terms of the valuation have you left enough money on the table for shareholders? Do you think it is a fair valuation in terms of the price band?Madhur: We absolutely think so. That was an important benchmark for us which is not only the valuation but also making sure that we have really high-quality investors who are joining us as a part of the journey.At least to the extent we could, we want to make sure that we get really really high-quality investors on Paytm's cap-table, people who understand this journey, who understand how big commerce and cloud can be, how big payments can be, how good financial services can be.A lot of numbers (valuation) were rumored, none of them were from us ... $22-25 bn and all. But it was important for us to leave enough and more not just for retail investors which should always be an objective but also for the highest quality institutional investors. This exercise was not about getting the last rupee or dollar of valuation.Have any of Paytm's businesses attained enough scale where it is generating cash to fund other businesses?Madhur: Our model is that our payments business- consumers and merchants that makes revenue and is profitable. All of the other businesses whether it is commerce and cloud or financial services adds significant profitability and contribution margin on top. Which is why what you would have seen is that last year our contribution profit for the whole year was about 13% and in the first quarter the number was 27%.So we are seeing a significant jump in contribution margin partly because of payments becoming more efficient but partly because of other line items of businesses which have a very high contribution margin. So we are seeing that trajectory in our business. Two years ago this number was negative.So we have come a long way in becoming very very efficient as a business.One thing which I would point to which is there in our RHP is that we did 2.8 million loans in the last quarter just in the September quarter alone. In the entire year, last year that was 3 million and that is a profitable business and is growing very fast. We see multiple such businesses, whether it is cloud, advertising, commerce, or financial services becoming very sizable in terms of their contribution margin.In the last couple of years, the competition in sectors such as payments, lending, broking, and overall financial services has intensified. Going forward what sort of an outlook does Paytm have? Also, your Q1 FY22 numbers show growth in revenue but also losses due to higher expenses. Paytm’s losses stood at Rs 382 crore for the quarter ended June 2021. How will you grow with profitability? What is the vision?Vijay: India market has three key beauties.It has a large number of underserved customers. You can have ten more large banks and then still India will not be able to say that we have more than enough. GDP growth is possible only when banks start to lend or lending institutions start to lend and then the capital goes into the economy. That possibility can only happen when there is so much competition and none of the competition is the zero-sum competition. It always has addressed a new segment and a new market opportunity.In India, we need more number and types of companies, institutions that are able to accelerate credit to the small person, business, or individual. This is an underserved market.Second, there is a large customer base like you and me who are smartphone (users). Desktop internet models or branch model is continuously in decline because now more and more things are happening on a smartphone.The third is a market where there is a new product to serve to the customers.Thanks to all these for the next 3-5 years, we are not even concerned about what kind of growth potential could come. The only swing that you could see would be due to something beyond our hands meaning some market situation or micro situation.India's financial services sector is continuously going to grow and we all have an advantage. I am not even concerned about the competition. I am actually saying that more players grow the market. We saw it in payments five years ago.Madhur: We are in a very different market. In the US for eCommerce to grow, malls had to shut down. That's just not the market we are living in, in India, where there is a huge amount of untapped opportunity.Just to go back to your questions on financials, we will continue to focus on growing our contribution margin. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that we will continue to make investments in growing our merchant network, technology. We need to make investments as we go along but the focus would be to get to a very meaningful contribution profit.From a village in Aligarh to helming the biggest IPO in India- it is the stuff of startup legend. What emotions are you going through today?We all write about the great American dream. I believe the time has come to write stories and books on the great Indian saga.I wish that we as Paytm and teammates become the champion of it, stand for and inspire many more to come to do that. We believe we are the change agent that will bring these financial services to the nook and corner which will grow the common economy and we all will rise again. Our success is not a success of generating more money or more profit. Our success will be the success when the financial services whether it is credit, banking, insurance, it is not premium customers' product but is a common customers' product in an easy to understand way.I cannot tell you how elated I am. Today is the day when we are starting a journey to invite many more to join our mission and to everyone who is potentially going to join, this is a mission to change the fate of this country and not just to make money.It will be an understatement and failure of us to benchmark the money that the Paytm journey makes. It will be a better success that how much of our economy grew because of our IPO.",True,,,

It narrowed losses to Rs 1,701 crore during the same period from Rs 2,942 crore in the previous year.One97 Communications, the parent firm of Paytm, was founded by Vijay Shekhar Sharma in 2000. It began its journey as a value-added service provider, and evolved over the years to become an online mobile payments firm.The company spent almost a decade catering to the VAS market. It made its first pivot with the launch of a mobile recharge platform in 2010. Until then, customers used to pay cash to get their phones recharged by offline retailers. Over 90 percent of Indian telecom users had pre-paid connections in India at the time. Ten years later, the market hasn't changed much.For the three months ended June 2021, Paytm has seen a huge uptick in its revenues driven by its payments and financial services offerings.The company’s revenue was up by 46 percent to Rs 948 crore in the first quarter of financial year 2022 from Rs 649 crore in the like period of the previous financial year. Paytm’s losses stood at Rs 3,82 crore for the three months ended June 2021.Currently, Paytm is betting big on its lending vertical. And as per its RHP in the second quarter of financial year 2022, it disbursed 2.84 million loans.Interestingly, this is not One97's first attempt to go public. In 2010, the company, which then used to provide value-added services (VAS) for telecom customers, planned to raise Rs 120 crore ($28 million, basis a decade-old conversion rate) through an IPO. It had to cancel its plan because of market volatility.The company currently has around 10,266 employees.Also read: Paytm's path to IPO: Tracking a 2-decade journey of pivots",True,,,

CNBC reports Verizon is teaming with Amazon to improve fixed wireless internet access in rural areas in the US. The alliance will initially concentrate on expanding Verizon’s LTE and 5G service using Amazon’s Project Kuiper for “backhaul,” boosting coverage in areas with little or no high-speed data.Amazon and Verizon later hope to offer unified internet access for industries worldwide, including smart farms and transportation. For now, they’re establishing technical requirements for rural broadband using Project Kuiper antenna tech already in development.The two didn’t provide a timeline for this satellite-augmented service. Amazon recently lined up rocket launches for Project Kuiper, but it doesn’t expect to have half its satellites in low Earth orbit until 2026. The full constellation is expected no later than July 2029.There’s an enemy-of-my-enemy aspect to this deal. Amazon and Verizon are racing to compete with SpaceX’s rapidly developing Starlink service — they both risk losing customers if Starlink claims too strong a foothold, including corporate clients like Google. All the same, Americans might not mind if this brings fast internet access to more parts of the country. Rural internet coverage is still far from complete, even with the FCC investing billions in 5G — this could fill in the gaps without having to wire as much of the countryside as before.Editor’s note: This article originally appeared on Engadget.{{{author}}}{{{date}}}",True,,,

You can also see our Privacy PolicySpaceX's first tourist flight seemed to go swimmingly last month, but there was a hidden problem beneath the floorboards.That issue came from the bathroom - the toilet tucked away in the Crew Dragon spaceship's ceiling, which is shrouded in proprietary secrecy. A tube carrying urine from that toilet broke loose in an area beneath the spaceship's cabin floor, releasing its contents onto a fan. That fan is used to create suction for the toilet, which is necessary because when you're doing in microgravity, there's no force pulling waste in any one direction. The fan then sprayed the pee all over the hidden compartment.Even though all of this happened in microgravity, the pee didn't drift into the cabin. That kept it away from the spaceship's four passengers: billionaire Jared Isaacman, geoscientist Dr. Sian Proctor, physician-assistant Hayley Arceneaux, and engineer Chris Sembroski. While they orbited Earth for three days, on a mission called Inspiration4, they didn't notice the issue, SpaceX representatives told reporters on Monday.""We didn't really even notice it, the crew didn't even notice it, until we got back,"" SpaceX official Bill Gerstenmaier said in a press conference Monday, according to The New York Times. ""When we got the vehicle back, we looked under the floor and saw the fact that there was contamination underneath the floor of Inspiration4.""A mechanical issue with the toilet fan had, however, set off an alarm while Inspiration4 was in orbit, prompting the passengers to troubleshoot, Isaacman told CNN Business in September. He did not reveal how they solved the problem. Upon the spaceship's return to Earth, SpaceX technicians opened the cabin floor to investigate the fan issue. That's when they discovered the pee leak.As SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has promised on Twitter, the toilet system is getting an upgrade. SpaceX is redesigning the leaky tube beneath Crew Dragon's floor for its next launch, which will carry four NASA astronauts to the International Space Station this weekend. With the new upgrade, the tube shouldn't come ""unglued"" again, Gerstenmaier said.Another Crew Dragon capsule is currently attached to the space station, since it carried four astronauts to the space station in April and is waiting to carry them back to Earth in the coming weeks. But it has the same plumbing system as the capsule that suffered a leak.Fearing the same toilet troubles, SpaceX asked the astronauts on the space station to snake a camera on a cable into the pee-tube compartment beneath the floor. Sure enough, they discovered the same issue as Inspiration4.""Yes, there was some indication of some contamination under the floor,"" Gerstenmaier said.That could be a more serious issue for this spaceship, which has been in Earth's orbit for nearly six months, and has presumably been carrying loose urine the whole time.After astronauts pee, that urine gets mixed with a substance called Oxone, which removes ammonia so that it doesn't build up in the air. But Oxone can be corrosive, so SpaceX is investigating the possibility that the Oxone-pee mixture could have damaged the spaceship after months of floating around beneath its cabin floor.SpaceX engineers tested this theory on the ground, Gerstenmaier said, according to the Times, by gathering some aluminum parts similar to those on the spaceship and soaking them in an oxone-urine mixture. The engineers put those parts in a chamber that imitates the humidity conditions of the space station.

The new financing round, which is subject to approval from the country’s insurance regulator, was led by General Atlantic and Multiples Private Equity.CPPIB, Canada’s largest pension fund and Lightspeed Growth as well as existing investors Intact Ventures and Munich Re Ventures also participated in the round, which values the five-year-old startup at $1.1 billion, up from $500 million a year ago.Acko is attempting to take on the country’s antiquated insurance industry with a digital-first product. It develops and sells bite-sized auto insurance products (aimed at drivers and others in transportation-related scenarios), healthcare protections to employers, as well as protection on gadgets.The startup has distribution partners with a number of firms including Amazon, which is an existing investor in Acko, as well as travel and hotel booking platform MakeMyTrip, ride-hailing firm Ola, insurance giant Bajaj Finance and Urban Company.Acko covers nearly a million gig workers in the country through partnerships with companies including food delivery giants Swiggy and Zomato. Overall, Acko has amassed over 70 million customers and is clocking a run rate of $175 million in premiums.Offering a large catalog of bite-sized insurance policies is crucial for firms in India. Only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and most can’t afford sizable policies.According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017. An average Indian makes about $2,100 a year, according to the World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.“ACKO has meaningfully redefined the protection category for consumers and plans to continue innovating in the space. We strongly believe in supporting our customers in protecting their valued assets or the health and safety of their loved ones via a differentiated product and value-added service,” said Acko founder and chief executive Varun Dua.“Insurance and protection must work for people based on their unique risks and needs in a seamless, reliable fashion. We are thrilled to partner with trusted investors who have a deep understanding of the regulatory environment and bring firsthand experience in working with innovative, high-growth companies.”The startup said it plans to deploy the fresh capital to broaden its healthcare offerings and hire more talent across technology, product and data science roles.“We also continue to deepen our health strategy and intend to invest over $150 million in the health business in the near future. We believe health insurance products, claims innovation and a deeply connected ecosystem of health services that improve health outcomes for customers are today’s most urgent needs.”The funding comes at a time when scores of Indian startups are raising record amounts of capital at an unprecedented pace in India. This week itself, cross-border payments startup Zolve, agritech firm DeHaat, fintech Groww, and edtech Teachmint unveiled their new funding rounds. TechCrunch reported earlier this week that Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital are in advanced stages of talks to mint another unicorn in India (DealShare).Policybazaar, which competes with Acko, will open its initial public offering next week. The startup is looking to raise over $800 million in the IPO.{{{author}}}{{{date}}}",True,,,

You can also see our Privacy PolicyThe Tesla stock holdings of billionaire investor Ron Baron's namesake fund have ballooned to more than $6.1 billion since he first invested in the electric carmaker in 2014. And he plans to stick with it as shares have reached new highs, making the company the second-fastest to reach a market cap of $1 trillion.""That is sort of a normal type of investment thing - a very long-term investment for us,"" he told CNBC Wednesday. ""I think we'll probably be an investor for another 10 years, same with SpaceX.""Baron Capital Management built its stake in Tesla between 2014 and 2016. The fund first invested $380 million at an average cost per share of $43.07, he said. Now, Tesla stock is priced at just over $1,000 a piece.His fund also owns around 1.3 million shares of Elon Musk's SpaceX, which was first purchased in September 2017. Baron Capital, with more than 400 investments in its portfolio and $58.9 billion of assets under management, has made its clients $54 billion of profits - of which $6.1 billion is from Tesla, the founder said. But the longtime Tesla bull - who predicted the company would hit a trillion-dollar valuation years before before it did - had his doubts too, saying holding the stock in earlier years wasn't easy amid significant gyrations.""When I first met Elon 10 years ago ... I was very skeptical about whether it would be successful,"" he said, adding that in his lifetime, more than 50 car companies he knew have failed. Then things started to take a turn for him when Tesla produced the Model S in 2012. Still, Baron said even Musk's friends thought the carmaker would not make for an attractive investment since the Tesla CEO wasn't focused on short-term profitability.Instead, Musk reinvested profits into building new factories, doing research, and launching new car models.""We're investing in businesses that are investing in themselves - that are penalizing current profits to become much larger businesses,"" Baron said. ""That's what he was doing.""SaleNextCopyright @ 2021. Times Internet Limited. All rights reserved.For reprint rights. Times Syndication Service.",True,,,

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/companies/policybazaar-ipo-profitability-is-a-choice-not-a-priority-says-founder-yashish-dahiya-7636881.html/amp?utm_campaign=fullarticle&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=inshorts ,"Policybazaar IPO | Profitability is a choice, not a priority, says founder Yashish Dahiya","""I think I could have had a simple, alternate life as an army person,"" Yashish Dahiya says.The co-founder and CEO of PB Fintech, the parent of insurance marketplace PolicyBazaar and lending platform PaisaBazaar, was the first person in his family to not join the Defence Forces. That said, joining the Army was his only goal till college, since it was the only life he had seen.But destiny had different plans for Dahiya, who went on to start PolicyBazaar in 2008. The IPO of PB Fintech will open on November 1 and close on November 3, 2021, at a price band of Rs 940-Rs 980. It is raising over $800 million at a valuation of $6 billion. In its 13-year history, it has raised $400 million, 60-70% of which is still in the bank. It recently received an insurance broking license, allowing it to foray into the offline insurance selling industry.Dahiya and his co-founder, Alok Bansal, who is the CFO of PB Fintech spoke to Moneycontrol on the business opportunities ahead, likely risks, path to profitability and his approach to entrepreneurship.Your Red Herring Prospectus (RHP) laid out the focus areas going forward. You will look at offline, health insurance, corporates, small and medium businesses as well as neo lending. Of these, what are your priorities going to be and where will the bulk of your investment be deployed?Dahiya: I think our focus will continue to be singular, which is protection for the middle class against the financial impact of death, disease, and disability. That has been our focus for the last 13 years, it will continue to be our focus for the coming 13 years too.In addition, we will do a lot of other activities, which strengthen our primary case. And those may be motor insurance, they may be savings products, they could even be credit cards and personal loans.A lot of the focus would be around insurance. In the future, for example, if we procure an account-aggregator license that again would be focused on the lending vertical. So our primary brands remain Policybazaar and Paisabazaar, and other activities support them.On the proceeds front, the company has raised around $400 million over the last 13 years. We still have about 60-70 percent of that money parked in our bank accounts. We have built both Policybazaar and Paisabazaar at about $70 million each. Now I know there were times when Info Edge built out the entire business with just Rs 7.3 crores and that is an exception, but that was a different time. In these times building out a consumer internet brand with about $70 million is not a bad result. We will continue to be frugal in the future also, but the focus will stay on growth.Bansal: There are four main deployment areas from our IPO fundraise. One is continued investment in increasing awareness in a way that consumers start to think of insurance as part of their financial planning. Next is expansion into physical stores, which gives the option to customers to meet us. This is more about service and increasing the convergence rather than scouting for business.The third area would be investing in our international business. We already have a presence in Dubai for the last couple of years, where we have taken baby steps. Now we are ready to expand with a bit more aggression. The fourth area will be scouting for investment or acquisition opportunities. If there are any specific complimentary tech skills, our team will be happy to look at those options. These will be more strategic in nature... not really looking at market-share acquisitions.Can you give us some more details on your offline expansion plans? How will it complement your online presence?Dahiya: Today health insurance and life insurance sales happen through a lot of conversations. Once a customer has decided on buying a product, they can either buy the policy on our website or through our call centre. But the customer may also prefer meeting representatives before buying a policy.In Delhi, where we have most of our team, we started putting in place some ability to go and meet the customer. It gave very good results, with much higher conversion rates than before. There are a million agents today, and the biggest pain point that an agent has is that he doesn't have too many customers. They don’t know how to expand beyond their small circle of customers.I can compare this model to that taxi driver who was in your neighborhood but did not know that you were going to the airport and needed a cab. What Uber did was just connect these two. So, with Policybazaar adopting this model, what has changed is that instead of meeting two or three customers a week, the agent is probably meeting 10 ready customers every day.Bansal: And this automatically started to play out without a lot of planning due to work from home and Covid-19. Because when our staff went back home during lockdowns, they realised that they can actually meet customers and they started assessing the impact it can have.What are your plans on the lending vertical? It is quickly becoming a crowded space, so how will you look to grow there while ensuring that the customers you deal with are not over-leveraged? And how will the revenue growth pan out from this vertical?Dahiya: See, insurance and lending are almost opposite categories, although they are quite similar in many ways. Both require a lot of data and a lot of analysis because you're taking risks in both. However, insurance is actually a bigger risk than lending because claims can be high. At the same time, consumers don't want to get up and buy insurance in droves. But they may take a loan easily, so the demand for credit is higher. That is the reason why Paisabazaar has almost double the traffic of Policybazaar.So, on one side it's an easy product to give to customers, but then a big challenge is that no one supplier can cover the entire market. There is a vast array of segments of consumers for lending. A marketplace is best suited to cover that entire market because it creates a panel of suppliers who can cover every need. There is also a neo-lending element to it. I think as time progresses, you will see us do a lot more white-label partnerships. We have already seen some of them come through.And yes, it is a crowded market, everything is crowded today. And maybe in India for the next 10 to 15 years it is going to stay that way.Let's talk about the risks. One is the risk that a lot of the insurance partners now want to own the stack end to end, including distribution and data. We have seen the likes of HDFC Ergo delisting from your platform. The other is there are a lot of niche insurance providers who are coming up with bite-sized insurance policies. So where do you see Policybazaar positioning itself amidst the changing landscape?Dahiya: Policybazaar is essentially focused on first of all customer education, that the customer must be educated about the need for health and life insurance. To me, that is the biggest requirement right now for the entire industry. So what does this education do? It makes customers come to us in large numbers. That gives an advantage to any insurance company promoting its product to such a large customer base on our platform. So, it is a symbiotic relationship. Even if more than one company wants to become the only platform to sell their product, the aggregator model becomes quite important. Because the customer requires the aggregator to compare the products. and who is going to provide that independent comparison, everybody will obviously say good things about their product?The policy we sell is not ours, the claim we pay is not with our money. So, we can be trusted to provide independent advice. As a consumer, you may prefer to deal with somebody who doesn't have that conflict.Your losses reduced by half from Rs 304 crore in FY20 to Rs 150 crore in FY21. When do you see the company turning profitable?Dahiya: Genuinely, profitability is a choice which we can achieve any quarter we wish to. It is not a priority. Because right now we are in an underpenetrated market. In that situation, do you try to become profitable for the 20 percent that is buying health insurance or try to convince the remaining 80 percent to also buy health insurance? I think the answer is quite clear. You try to convince the 80% to also buy health insurance.We are in a phase where we are growing the market for the next seven to 10 years. There is a long journey ahead. On a unit economics basis, the business is profitable. Every time we do business, we are prudent, we do not lose money. And another proof of it is, that we have not spent 70 percent of the money that we have raised. That tells you that just because we have access to a large sum of money does not mean we start spending. Prudence. You know Info Edge co-founder Sanjeev Bikhchandani says it very well, that the best companies in the world built over decades are the ones that have focused on return on capital employed. And that is what we believe is the true value. We have burned $150 million, which is a lot of money, but the company's valuation is at $6 billion. That's a decent return on capital. All our investors have done well.Unlike many other companies?Dahiya: No no, I did not mean it that way. Everybody has their own reasons. It's very hard to build these businesses. You know, honestly, many times it's very easy to comment. It's very hard to build.Yashish, you are also an unusual entrepreneur. You come from a very different background; I remember you saying once that you're perhaps the only civilian in a family that has had a lot of members in the Armed Forces. You've done the Ironman triathlon. So all these life experiences, how did they shape you as an entrepreneur and in the way you have built PB Fintech in the last decade?Dahiya: So there is a mission aspect to me. It's not just the financial aspects, I think I could have had a very simple alternate life as an army person. The mission purpose is quite deep, I usually find that I'm able to focus on the core purpose, which is, in this case, health and life insurance for the middle class in India, and keep that primary and not get distracted from it.I think also my experiences have given me a unique perspective because when we were in the army till I became an adult, all my costs were covered by the military hospitals. It was when I became an adult that I realised that as a civilian, you have to pay for all these things! Also in my stint in the United Kingdom healthcare was always there. So to me, the fact that we don't think about these issues is strange, that people don't think enough about the fact that they will be a health crisis. I've always thought this, ever since I was a civilian, that (an employer can) deduct a share of my salary, but (must) give me the same benefits as a government job. Which is, give me a pension and health care. But I don't think people appreciate it as much as I do. Because I come from a world where that was the norm.",True,,,

It was a close shave for the pedestrian – a maid, who managed to pull herself out of the crater with the help of pipes – and the siblings whom locals rescued with the help of a ladder.

CCTV footage of the incident, which has been widely circulated on social media, shows that the road caved in just after a school bus crossed the area, near Dandi Swami Chowk, around 8am. The road collapsed so abruptly that the students who were at the brink of the chasm were caught unwares and were unable to save themselves, while the two-wheeler behind them was able to apply the brake in time. {{{headline}}}Incidentally, the students are relatives of municipal corporation assistant town planner Satish Malhotra and the cave-in took place just 50m from the old residence of mayor Balkar Sandhu, who also arrived at the spot.An eyewitness, Harinder Singh, said, “Fortunately, sewer water did not accumulate in the crater, otherwise the students could have drowned.

Fortunately, a major tragedy was averted.”Municipal corporation sub divisional officer Anshul Garcha said the civic body is investigating the matter and the cause for the road collapse is yet to be ascertained. “Underground wires could be seen. It is suspected that they may have damaged the sewer lines, resulting in leakage and soil erosion. We are repairing the road.” The cave-in was reported in a congested area with a residential-cum-commercial building on one side of the damaged road portion. The building was vacant, while shops have been closed as residents fear that the foundation of the building may have been damaged.{{{headline}}}This site and its partners use technology such as cookies to personalize content and ads and analyse traffic.

The new law, which will be implemented from January 1, has been promulgated amid a protracted military standoff between India and China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border, in eastern Ladakh.The law, which says China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are “sacred and inviolable”, merges military defence of China’s land borders with improving social and economic development in border areas.When specifically asked about India’s concerns on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said: “We hope relevant countries can avoid making undue speculation about the normal legislation in China. This law has clear stipulations on China’s cooperation with its neighbouring countries and the handling of the land border issues. It will not affect China’s implementation of existing border treaties nor will it change existing practice in our cooperation with neighbouring countries.{{{headline}}}On Monday, India’s external affairs ministry had put out a statement voicing its concerns about the legislation. “China’s unilateral decision to bring about a legislation which can have implications on our existing bilateral arrangements on border management as well as on the boundary question is of concern to us,” the ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi had said.The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, however, said it will not change China’s position on border issues.“It (the new law) does not mean that there is a change in our position on the border development issue,” Wang said in his response to a question on the implication of the law.Explaining the law, Wang said the law identifies the leading mechanism and duties of the departments of military and localities in implementing the law. “It sets the rules for the demarcation procedures and also covers the areas of defence and management of borders as far as international cooperation (is concerned),” he said.“China has 22,000km of land borders. It has 14 land neighbours. The promulgation of the law is to coordinate and have unified standards for strengthening border management and advance relevant cooperation,” Wang said.“This is an important measure in advancing the rule of law. It is a normal domestic legislation that serves our realistic needs and also conforms to international practice,” he said. “This law has clear stipulations on China’s cooperation with its neighbouring countries and the handling of the land border issues.”Wang only made a passing reference to the Chinese military’s role in border management but the new law strengthens a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) policy to work closely with civilians staying in border areas.“Under the leadership of the Central Military Commission, relevant military organs shall organise, guide and coordinate the defence and control of land borders, maintain social stability, handle emergencies and cooperate in border defence and other related work,” Article 7 of the law says.India and China have been locked in a border row for 17 months, a standoff which has seen a deadly skirmish in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on June 15, 2020, when troops from both sides fought each other hand-to-hand and with rods and stones for hours.Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash, the first fatalities on the LAC since 1975; four Chinese soldiers were also killed and one injured.Radical Islamist group TLP threatens to bring Islamabad to a standstillUS economy slowed to a 2% annual growth rate last quarter in face of Delta waveN.

Gosavi, according to Pune police, was arrested in the case lodged four years ago. He was on the run and introduced himself as Sachin Patil during his stay in Lucknow, Jabalpur, Hyderabad and Fatehpur, police said.“Gosavi was projecting himself as a member of Stop Crime NGO and CIBCA detective agency. He also claimed to run an export-import business. We were searching for him based on his social media photos,” Amitabh Gupta, Pune Police commissioner told HT.He said that the Pune Police earlier arrested Gosavi’s assistant, Sherbano Kureshi, in the cheating case. The case pertains to allegations of Gosavi cheating Chinmay Deshmukh of ₹3.09 lakh under the pretext of getting him a job in Malaysia. The police said that the recipient of the money was Sherbano Kureshi. On 2019, the Pune Police filed the chargesheet in the case.{{{headline}}}The Pune Police denied any relation between the arrest and the ongoing controversy regarding Gosavi’s presence in the cruise ship during the raids carried out by NCB following which actor Shah Rukh Khan’s son Aryan Khan, Arbaaz Merchant and Munmun Dhamecha were arrested for alleged possession of drugs. All three were granted bail by the Bombay high court on Thursday and are expected to walk out of jail on Saturday.Earlier, a lookout notice was also issued to prevent Gosavi from leaving the country. The other witness in the raid, BJP worker Manish Bhanushali, has also been summoned by Mumbai Police for questioning in an unrelated matter.{{{headline}}}This site and its partners use technology such as cookies to personalize content and ads and analyse traffic.

The remarks were made in an editorial column in the TMC’s mouthpiece daily newspaper ‘Jago Bangla’, news agency PTI reported.“We want an alliance to be formed against the BJP. We have said this to the Congress, too. But it is least bothered and shows a lackadaisical approach,” PTI reported, citing an excerpt from the editorial.“The Congress is limited to Twitter space. The party has taken no initiative to build an opposition alliance. In 2014 and 2019, too, the Congress had done the same,” the editorial further said.Also read | BJP will remain powerful for decades, predicts poll strategist Prashant KishorThe TMC also reiterated that the party would expand its base to other states and put up a fight against the ruling BJP at the Centre. This came on the day party supremo and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee began her three-day visit to poll-bound Goa, her maiden trip to the coastal state.{{{headline}}}“As I prepare for my maiden visit to Goa on 28th, I call upon all individuals, organisations and political parties to join forces to defeat the BJP and their divisive agenda. The people of Goa have suffered enough over the last 10 years,” Banerjee tweeted earlier in the week.Referring to the Bengal chief minister’s proposal during a meeting of opposition parties on August 20 this year for a joint steering committee, the editorial said there has been no progress on that matter since then. The meeting was convened by Congress' interim president Sonia Gandhi.However, the editorial also noted the TMC would “keep the doors of alliance with the Congress open,” and said, “We have never said that an opposition alliance will be forged without the Congress. But we will not waste our time for them by sitting idle.”Lately, the two parties that have been supportive of forming an united opposition alliance have been making similar remarks about each other. Earlier on Sunday, veteran Congress leader P Chidambaram, who is also the party’s election observer for Goa, told news agency PTI in an interview that the TMC and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) would be “marginal players” and the Congress was ""best positioned"" to defeat the BJP in the assembly polls.Why is Aryan Khan granted bail today?

This release is in addition to normal GST compensation being released every two months out of actual cess collection.Subsequent to the 43rd GST council meeting held on May 28, 2021, it was decided that the central government would borrow Rs 1.59 lakh crore and release it to states and union territories with the legislature on a back-to-back basis to meet the resource gap due to the short release of compensation on account of the inadequate amount in the compensation fund.This amount is as per the principles adopted for a similar facility in Financial Year 2020-2021, where an amount of Rs 1.10 lakh crore was released to states under a similar arrangement. This amount of Rs 1.59 lakh crore would be over and above the compensation in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore (based on cess collection) that is estimated to be released to states, union territories with legislature during this financial year. The sum total of Rs 2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in FY 2021-2022.All eligible states and UTs (with Legislature) have agreed to the arrangements of funding of the compensation shortfall under the back-to-back loan facility. For effective response and management of COVID-19 pandemic and a step-up in capital expenditure, all states and union territories have a very important role to play.

This release is in addition to normal GST compensation being released every two months out of actual cess collection.Subsequent to the 43rd GST council meeting held on May 28, 2021, it was decided that the central government would borrow Rs 1.59 lakh crore and release it to states and union territories with the legislature on a back-to-back basis to meet the resource gap due to the short release of compensation on account of the inadequate amount in the compensation fund.  This amount is as per the principles adopted for a similar facility in Financial Year 2020-2021, where an amount of Rs 1.10 lakh crore was released to states under a similar arrangement. This amount of Rs 1.59 lakh crore would be over and above the compensation in excess of Rs 1 lakh crore (based on cess collection) that is estimated to be released to states, union territories with legislature during this financial year. The sum total of Rs 2.59 lakh crore is expected to exceed the amount of GST compensation accruing in FY 2021-2022.All eligible states and UTs (with Legislature) have agreed to the arrangements of funding of the compensation shortfall under the back-to-back loan facility. For effective response and management of COVID-19 pandemic and a step-up in capital expenditure, all states and union territories have a very important role to play. For assisting the states/UTs in their endeavour, the Ministry of Finance has frontloaded the release of assistance under the back-to-back loan facility during FY 2021-22 of Rs 1,59,000 crore.The release of Rs 44,000 crore being made now is funded from borrowings of government in five-year securities issued in the current financial year, at a Weighted Average Yield of 5.69 per cent.

The party has also decided to conduct an inquiry into the case.Jayachandran was a Peroorkada local committee member and a senior leader of the party trade union wing Centre for Indian Trade Unions.A party leader said the decision to strip Jayachandran was taken by the local committee in Peroorkada on the direction of the district committee.Former student activist Anupama S Chandran, who struggled to get the party to act against her father for months, said the belated move is an eyewash and demanded a state committee-level probe the missing child’s case.“Nothing will emerge if the case is investigated by the local committee. I want a high-level inquiry, and women leaders should be part of it,” she said in state capital Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. Jayachandran was not available for comment. Earlier, he said the party was aware of everything, but it disowned him when issue took the national stage.{{{headline}}}A senior CPM leader, who did not want to be quoted, said further action will be taken against Jayachandran and officials of the child welfare committee, who allegedly colluded with him in the adoption.A Thiruvananthapuram court will hear the anticipatory bail petitions filed by Jayachandran and five others on Thursday.In a police complaint filed last week, Anupama S Chandran alleged that her father took away her child born in October last year and handed over the newborn to a state child welfare council-run orphanage. She alleged the child was reportedly given to a family from Andhra Pradesh in violation of adoption rules. But Jayachandran said he sent the baby to the government-run children’s home in Thiruvananthapuram with his daughter’s consent and contended that his daughter also signed a legal document to this effect. His daughter rebutted him, insisting that she was forced to sign the document.Chandran’s one-day fast before the state secretariat on Saturday for her child attracted national attention. Many senior leaders of the CPM including politburo members Brinda Karat and MA Baby decried inaction in her case. Despite the senior leaders’ intervention, the party failed to take action against him. The issue also figured prominently in the state assembly. Opposition leader V D Satheesan termed it an “honour kidnapping” while state health minister Veena George insisted that all procedures were followed when the baby was given for adoption.

They were children and young boys and this should serve as an eye-opener for the BJP,"" Abdullah said at a public meeting in Surankote in Poonch district.The BJP claims a new phase has started and militancy has finished but the situation is otherwise, Abdullah said. He said Shah was the one who announced the state's special status under Article 370 being revoked and also witnessed the celebrations after the Pakistan's cricket win on Sunday.""They (the BJP) took away Article 370 and Article 35A from us and claim not a single bullet was fired. How could bullets have been fired when you have put a soldier outside the door of every household? A volcano is building up even as they think they have silenced (the people)...This volcano will erupt one day and god knows what will be its shape and size. They have to return Article 370 to the people of Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.In August 2019, the government revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and bifurcated the state into the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.Addressing the rally, Abdullah also defended his advocacy for a dialogue between India and Pakistan and asked people to pray to the almighty for good sense to prevail in both the countries and for a way out in the larger interest of peace and development in the subcontinent.Taking a dig at the BJP-led government, he said its policies triggered farmer unrest in the country even as it was asked to send the three farm bills to the select committee in parliament.Both India and Pakistan, the former chief minister said, spend a major chunk of their revenues in preparing for war, impacting their poor.""The people of Jammu and Kashmir are sandwiched between the animosities of the two countries. The hostility is also the main reason to spread hatred and divide people on the name of Hindus and Muslims,"" he said.In his view, political parties in both countries are winning elections in the name of Kashmir.""They (Pakistan) say Kashmir is our jugular vein and we have been suffering for 75 years. This side says this is our land and we will take back the land which is under the illegal occupation of Pakistan. Nobody has asked the people of Jammu and Kashmir where we stand,"" he said.Abdullah asked the people to be united and frustrate the designs of those bent on dividing them on communal lines.Mahatma Gandhi, he said, had seen a ray of hope in Kashmir. ""We will become the beacon of that light once again and spread across the country by upholding unity and brotherhood.""Any government which oppresses its people and fails to mitigate their sufferings is bound to vanish.

Without taking names, he said: “Earlier, they abused Lord Ram. Now, with the elections approaching, they are coming to Ayodhya to pay obeisance to the deity after realising that they will not be able to sail through in the upcoming elections. This is good. At least they have accepted the existence and importance of Ram,” said Adityanath.“But let us not forget that there was no opposition leader in the country who didn’t criticize babuji (referring to the then chief minister Kalyan Singh) on December 6, 1992,” he added. The attack was timed with Kejriwal’s two-day Ayodhya visit during which he promised that the Delhi government would arrange for free Ayodhya visits for the masses. AAP is set to contest the 2022 UP polls early next year. {{{headline}}}Adityanath also targeted other opposition parties. “While the opposition parties vied over hosting iftaar, during Hindu festivals curfews forced by riots spoiled the show for the majority community,” he said. His attack on the opposition came at a social justice meeting comprising members of Lodh, the Other Backward Caste (OBC) community, to which former chief minister Kalyan Singh belonged. The chief minister also accused his Delhi counterpart of abandoning UP’s migrants, forcing them out of Delhi during the Covid-induced lockdown. “There is someone from Delhi who had forced people of UP out of the National Capital during the lockdown. Now, he is announcing freebies. Someone who couldn’t handle UP people in Delhi is positioning himself as one who could handle all of UP,” said Yogi Adityanath. Kalyan Singh, who belonged to the Lodh sub-caste of OBCs, was the chief minister of UP when the Babri mosque was razed by kar sevaks in December, 1992. He always maintained that he refused to give permission to the security forces to fire at kar sevaks who had gathered at Ayodhya, a point Adityanath has been raising in his speeches at BJP’s caste meets. On October 30, 1990, the police had opened fire at kar sewaks who gathered in Ayodhya on the call given by VHP, RSS and the BJP when the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party government was in power. “Had there been a BJP government in UP in 1990, no power on earth would have dared to fire at kar sevaks,” Adityanath has been stating repeatedly in his speeches. Adityanath also targeted the main opposition Samajwadi Party for tweaking its publicity tagline ‘main aa raha hoon (I am coming)’. “This simply means that lawlessness, anarchy, mayhem, goonda raj among other things is returning. That is why one should not vote for such parties,” he said.{{{headline}}}This site and its partners use technology such as cookies to personalize content and ads and analyse traffic.

Sonia’s telephone call came yesterday after Lalu Prasad Yadav’s rebuke to the Congress over fielding candidates in Bihar bypolls. Talking to media today ahead of his by-poll campaign, Lalu Yadav said that the Congress president enquired about his health and whereabouts.“I spoke to Sonia Gandhi. She asked me about my well-being and whereabouts. I told her that Congress is an all India party and she should get all like-minded people and parties together to form a strong alternative (to the ruling party) and should call a meeting of all people,” said RJD leader Lalu Prasad Yadav.It may be recalled that RJD is one of the oldest allies of the Congress party and Lalu Yadav was railway minister during the UPA-I. Both the parties had an alliance in Bihar as well for the assembly elections. However, in the bypolls, the RJD has decided to go solo which left the Congress fuming and the grand old party also fielded its candidate from both the by-poll seats.Lalu Yadav had returned to Bihar after a gap of three years. When he was questioned about the difference with the Congress over bypolls seat sharing, Lalu Yadav had made stinging remarks. “What is the alliance with Congress? Should we have left everything to Congress for a defeat? For forfeiting deposits?” Lalu Yadav had said a few days ago.On the other hand, Bihar Congress chief Bhakt Charan Das had said that there is no friendship left between the Congress and the RJD. “Had there been a friendship, we would have not been contesting against each other,” Das had said.Meanwhile, BJP leader and former Deputy CM of Bihar Sushil Modi had termed the rift between RJD and Congress a drama and a ‘noora kushti’ (fixed fight). “They have strategically announced a candidate. Congress’ only aim is to make RJD win, it’s not contesting to win, but to make RJD win…They will unite on the last day of polls….Once the bypoll ends, Congress will go back to Lalu wagging its tail…The two can’t be separated, just pretending to cut NDA’s votes…In Assembly polls, people voted for NDA, not RJD…this time too, NDA will win the bypolls with a majority,” Sushil Modi had said.Get live Stock Prices from BSE, NSE, US Market and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds, Check out latest IPO News, Best Performing IPOs, calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator, know market’s Top Gainers, Top Losers &amp; Best Equity Funds.

Mexico’s National Institute of Anthropology and History did not say whether any of the remains were disturbed or destroyed by the train project, which in some places runs alongside existing rail lines. It described the ruins as being “on the edge of the project.”Potential damage to the environment and archaeological sites are some of the reasons why critics oppose the project pushed by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.The finds range from pottery and simple stone outlines of thatched pre-Hispanic Maya homes to ceremonial platforms. Archaeologists said they were particularly impressed by the find of two ceramic vessels with handles or bases in the shape of human breasts.The sites were detected on the first, 140-mile (228-kilometer) stretch of the 950-mile (1,500- kilometer) train line that will run in a rough loop around Yucatan. That first stretch runs from the Mayan ruins of Palenque to the highway crossroad at Escarcega.The first four stages of the train project run through areas that were probably intensely occupied by the Mayas, who formed a sprawling empire of city-states across the Yucatan and Central America between 2000 B.C. and A.D. 900. Their descendants still live on the peninsula.The fifth and sixth stretches run along the resort-studded Caribbean coast. But the seventh and final stretch that runs near the jungle ruin site of Calakmul may also yield high numbers of finds. No immediate reports were available on how many artifacts had been found on the other stretches of the project so far.Experts already knew about the existence of some of the sites announced Thursday, but some are new.The train is intended to connect Caribbean beach resorts to the peninsula’s interior, with largely indigenous populations and ruin sites, in a bid to stimulate economic development around its 15 stations. The government says it will cost as much as $6.8 billion, but others say it will be much more.Critics say López Obrador rammed through the project without adequate study of its effects on the environment, underground sinkhole caves known as cenotes, and ruin sites. Some stretches of the route already have tracks, and the institute said some artefacts had already been disturbed by railway construction decades ago. But other stretches are to push through sensitive jungle terrain, though they will parallel existing roads or transmission lines. Even where an old railway line exists, the project would imply updating tracks and building new stations. Some Mayan communities have filed court challenges against the project, arguing it will cause environmental damage. They also say they were not adequately consulted about it or they will not share in its benefits.",True,,,

Weather phenomenon La Nina explained - Hindustan Times","A weather phenomenon associated with harsher winters is set to severely impact the climate in India, according to weather experts. La Nina is threatening to send the temperature in North India plunging to as low as 3 degrees Celsius.January and February will be particularly cold, according to forecasters, after which the temperature will recover, a report in Bloomberg stated.It also said that La Nina appears to have emerged across the equatorial Pacific, setting the stage for worsening droughts in California and South America, frigid winters in parts of the US and Japan and greater risks for the world’s already strained energy and food supplies.What is La Nina?La Nina means Little Girl in Spanish. According to National Ocean Service of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NIAA), US Department of Commerce, La Nina is also sometimes called El Viejo, or anti-El Nino.The phenomenon begins when the atmosphere reacts to a cooler patch of water over the Pacific Ocean. Signs have been emerging for months that the pattern was likely forming, marking the world's second La Nina in a row.{{{headline}}}La Nina - like its counterpart, El Nino - usually peaks in the Northern Hemisphere's winter, but its effects can trigger widespread consequences across the globe.What happens during La Nina?Explaining the phenomenon, NOAA said it forms after reverse interaction of weather conditions with trade winds, the permanent east-to-west prevailing winds that flow in the Earth's equatorial region.During normal conditions in the Pacific Ocean, trade winds take warm water from South America towards Asia. To replace that warm water, cold water rises from the depths, and the is called upwelling.La Nina is one of the two opposing climate patterns that breaks these normal conditions.Strong currents during La NinaDuring La Nina, trade winds are even stronger than usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia, said NOAA. This leads to increasing in upwelling off the west coast of the Americas, which brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface.These cold waters in the Pacific push the jet stream northward. NOAA added that La Nina can lead to a more severe hurricane season.How long do these weather phenomenon last?Episodes of La Nina typically last nine to 12 months, but can sometimes last for years. Such events occur every two to seven years, on average, but they don't occur on a regular schedule. Generally, El Nino occurs more frequently than La Nina.CO2 concentrations hit new record despite Covid-19 curbs last year: UNIndia among 11 'countries of concern': US intel report on climate change400 city forests to come up across India, says Union ministerIndia among nations to lose most work hours due to heatThis site and its partners use technology such as cookies to personalize content and ads and analyse traffic.

It's 28 million light-years away - Hindustan Times,"For the first time, signs of a planet transiting a star outside of the Milky Way galaxy may have been detected. “Chandra scientists have found the first possible planet candidate outside of our galaxy! Located about 28 million light years from Earth in galaxy M51, it's thousands of times farther away than all the other exoplanets detected in our Milky Way,” the Chandra X-ray Observatory tweeted on Monday.The potential exoplanet, called M51-ULS-1b, lies 28 million light-years away in the spiral galaxy Messier 51 (M51), also known as the Whirlpool galaxy. ""We are trying to open up a whole new arena for finding other worlds,"" Rosanne Di Stefano, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who led the study which found this object, said in a statement.According to the Chandra X-ray Observatory, this new discovery is based on transits, where the passage of a planet in front of a star blocks some of the star's light and yields a characteristic dip in brightness that can be detected by telescopes. This general technique has already been used to find thousands of exoplanets.For this study, astronomers used Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton space telescope to look at three galaxies beyond the Milky Way. In total, they looked at 55 different systems in M-51, the Whirlpool galaxy, 64 systems in Messier 101 (M-101), or the ""Pinwheel galaxy,"" and 119 systems in Messier 104, or the “Sombrero galaxy"".{{{headline}}}To spot the planet, the team led by Di Stefano used Chandra to look for dips in the brightness of X-rays. They found the possible exoplanet in the Whirlpool galaxy in a binary system orbiting two large objects: either a neutron star or a black hole which orbits a massive companion star.The transit, they witnessed, lasted a total of about three hours and the X-ray emissions dipped all the way to zero. This helped them to figure out that the object is likely approximately the size of Saturn and it orbits the neutron star (or a black hole) at a distance twice that of Saturn's distance from our sun.The first exoplanet discovered was in 1992 and, since then, most exoplanets found have been less than 3,000 light-years from Earth.‘Business park’ in outer space?

It’s the third announced commercial space station to date, coming just days after Voyager Space, Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin laid out their own plans for a commercial space station, which the group says will launch in 2027. Axiom Space is also planning a commercial station.Sierra Space originally announced its plans for a commercial space station in April of this year, part of a growing chorus of private companies looking to replace the soon-to-be-retired International Space Station. The company, a division of Sierra Nevada Corporation, has been developing a large inflatable LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment) habitat, which will be used for Orbital Reef. This latest news builds on those earlier announced plans.Orbital Reef will operate as an “off-world mixed use business park,” Blue Origin’s senior VP of advanced development program, Brent Sherwood said during a media event Monday. The space station could be used for many commercial purposes, including scientific research, manufacturing, media, entertainment and tourism, he mused. Orbital Reef will be capable of hosting 10 people once fully operational, and its internal volume will be around 90% of the current volume of the ISS.Image Credits: Orbital Reef (opens in a new window)Blue Origin will be providing core modules, utility systems and, crucially, the company’s heavy-lift New Glenn launch system. Boeing will conduct station operations, the science module and provide its Starliner crew spacecraft to ferry humans to and from the station. Redwire will provide microgravity research tech and in-space manufacturing, as well as payload operations and deployable structures.Maryland-based Genesis Engineering is developing a single-person spacecraft for routine operations and tourism purposes, while Arizona State University will lead a consortium to offer research advisory services.“The microgravity environment provides a whole new arena for scientific and commercial discovery,” Redwire’s executive VP for civil space and external affairs Mike Gold said. “We truly believe that the countries and companies that master microgravity research, development and manufacturing will be the global economic leaders of the future.”What’s less clear is how much the station is anticipated to cost. Company executives declined to specify exactly how much capital they’ll each be putting into the project, or the overall total anticipated investment. “The question you’re asking is part of our business case and [we’re] not going to give you a specific number,” Sherwood said.NASA is planning on investing up to $400 million on initial space station proposals as part of its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations project, but that money will be stretched between multiple proposals, and is likely to be just a fraction of the overall cost to develop and launch even a single station. Last month, NASA told CNBC that the agency had received “roughly about a dozen proposals” from companies vying for some of those funds.The other major piece of the puzzle is the launch capabilities of Blue Origin’s New Glenn, Boeing’s Starliner and Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser spaceplane. None of these vehicles have yet reached space, though Boeing is looking to try another test launch of Starliner in the first half of 2022. Blue Origin plans to launch New Glenn in the fourth quarter of this year, while Sierra Space has a contract with NASA for seven missions to the ISS using Dream Chaser.The story was updated to include additional details about Orbital Reef. {{{author}}}{{{date}}}",True,,,
