https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/what-are-the-best-jobs-in-2021/,What are the Best Jobs in 2021? - Codeup,"Apr 13, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsEvery year, Glassdoor names the 50 Best Jobs in America. The year is 2021 and would you look at that? The top 2 Best Jobs in 2021 just happen to coincide with the two programs we have at Codeup! A true coincidence? We think not. We know what jobs are in demand, and what jobs will see growth well into the future. Let’s take a look at what these jobs are and why they top the list! The #1 Best Job is not Software Developer, Software Engineer, or Computer Scientist. It is specifically Java Developer. What does this mean?A Java Developer is a developer whose work is largely focused on Java, which is both a programming language and a platform for application development. Many companies, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and Twitter, rely on Java for their websites. Java Developers are responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining Java applications. Such applications might include gaming websites, e-commerce websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more.What you will be by the time you graduate Codeup is a full-stack web developer. You will have learned to build web-based applications using Java, but it isn’t the only tool in your toolbox. You’ll also be comfortable coding with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and can integrate various coding languages to develop an application. You will know about front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and will be able to work in either one or both. Click here to view our curriculum. Java Developers are much less focused on design, and much more focused on the program architecture. This role has a heavier focus on computer science, and the coding is limited mostly to Java. Codeup students that particularly loved their 100+ hours in Java might decide to specialize, and seek out a Java Developer role.Why is it the best?Glassdoor determined the Best Jobs in 2021 based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. Java Developers have 10,103 job openings on Glassdoor. Most of the other jobs ranked on this list have under 10,000 job openings, and about half have less than 5,000. The median base salary across all levels of Java Developers is $90,830. The overall job satisfaction is 4.2 out of 5. This role is in-demand by employers, rated highly for job satisfaction, and pays very well. The #2 Best Job is not Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst. It is a Data Scientist.A Data Scientist (capital D, capital S) is a specific role that requires work across the entire data science pipeline. However, there are a number of roles a data scientist (lowercase D, lowercase S) can take! Their job title may not be “Data Scientist” but they can still work throughout the data science pipeline. However, they might choose to specialize in one area based on their own preferences or business needs, and take on a role like a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Analytics Specialist.After Codeup, you will be a data scientist. You’ve been trained and have gained experience working throughout the entire data science pipeline, including data wrangling, which many programs neglect. Our collective goal is for you to be hire-able as a Data Scientist, but many grads end up taking a more specific role. Other alumni job titles include Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and People Analytics Specialist. To learn more about the various careers in data science, based on our alumni’s job titles, check out the blog “What Data Science Career is for You?”Why is it the second best?As mentioned above, Glassdoor decides these rankings based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. There are 5,971 job openings on Glassdoor for Data Scientists. The median base salary for Data Scientists of all levels is $113,736. The job satisfaction rating is 4.1 out of 5. This is a very high paying role with high satisfaction rankings. In fact, it topped the Best Jobs list for four consecutive years until 2020! While the number of job openings for Data Scientists may not look terribly high, the growth rate is 31%, which is very high! Keep in mind, too, that Glassdoor is counting the jobs for Data Scientists, and not all the millions of positions that a data scientist might specialize in. There’s certainly a reason these are the two programs we teach here at Codeup! They are the best jobs out there, in booming industries, and in very high demand for employers. They can also offer lots of stability, flexibility, and work-life balance. No wonder they’re the 2 Best Jobs of 2021!Thinking about becoming a Java Developer for web-based applications?

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/inclusion-at-codeup-during-pride-month-and-always/,Inclusion at Codeup During Pride Month (and Always) - Codeup,"Jun 4, 2021 | Codeup NewsHappy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/coding-is-for-women/,Coding is for Women - Codeup,"Apr 27, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsIn a world where 91.5% of developers are male, it’s important to remember that coding is for women, too. Our first Coding is for Women event was a space for women interested in coding to come together (virtually) and learn from each other. Women tuned in from New York, Washington, New Mexico, and of course, our home base of Texas.  The panelists for this event were two members of our instructional staff with experience working in the tech industry. Here’s what they had to say about the barriers, opportunities, and overall experience getting into and working in tech! Madeleine: I graduated from Codeup’s first Data Science cohort, worked as a Data Scientist for about 2 years, and now I’m back as a Data Science instructor! I love this institution [Codeup] and can’t stay away from it.Jasmine: I graduated from Codeup’s Web Development program last June. Now, I’m working at Codeup as a Graduate Fellow, and have a part-time job as a React Native developer. Madeleine: I was a Starbucks barista and supervisor for 11 years. I went to college on and off, changed my major about 8 times, and had a two-year gap period. It was a long process by I ended up getting a Mathematics degree. I couldn’t find a way to utilize it, so that’s when I started looking into bootcamps. As soon as I graduated from Codeup, I immediately began working at Booz Allen Hamilton for a couple years.Jasmine: I was a Pharmacy Technician for about 7 years. I started as a cashier and worked my way up. I reached a point where there was no where else I could go. The next step would’ve been Pharmacist which I didn’t want to do, so I decided to pursue tech instead. Jasmine: As a pharm tech, I realized I was more interested in the software we were using than the medicine, and didn’t want to deal with the general public. I became curious about why the little Java coffee cup was popping up on my screen every day and started getting interested in the behind-the-scenes of the platform we were using. I knew that I could do it because there are a lot of transferable skills between the two careers.Madeleine: I got some experience programming in college, but it sat in the background and didn’t mesh well with my degree. After college, I realized I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my degree so I started working aimlessly, not knowing what to do. As much as I sincerely loved the service industry, it’s almost impossible to make a sustainable living. I wanted to start utilizing my skills more. I heard about data science but didn’t know what it meant. I looked into it more right as Codeup was opening their Data Science program. It was the perfect fit to make use of  my math, programming, and natural creative storytelling skills. Jasmine: I graduated Codeup after the pandemic struck, and the job search started to feel really isolating. I found this support group of women who would meet up every week, talk about the job search, what leads we had, troubles we were having, and made connections that led to the job I have now. So, it’s really important to find community and find support during the hard times. The women in tech groups are strong support communities and support systems!Madeleine: It was an old friend from high school, actually. After college, when I wasn’t really doing anything, we had reconnected. He had just signed up for a bootcamp, which was actually formerly Rackspace Cloud Academy, which is now Codeup Cloud Academy. He helped me understand how bootcamps can fill in the gaps of traditional academia, which tends to fail at helping people find satisfying careers. Then once I was in Codeup, I got so much guidance from the instructors and career advisors that I am very, very grateful for. Madeleine: It was extremely daunting. I was shoved into this tech world after working in coffee shops my whole life. Booz Allen is a firm full of extremely talented people. I taught myself cybersecurity on my own. The other data scientists before me were a Doctor of Computer Science and an Astrophysicist. So, I was sitting here with my Bachelor’s degree and a bootcamp certificate thinking “okay, I hope I got this.” It turned out Codeup prepared way more than I anticipated in that context, where I was able to use my tools from Codeup to identify flaws in the methodologies that were being used. I was able to improve it on a pretty quick turnaround. I was really able to secure my footing and get a good reputation in the field before I even felt confident in what I was doing. The imposter syndrome may never really goes away but it was great to see that I can use the tools that I’ve learned even though I’m doubting myself. Jasmine: In my current role, I’m using a technology that we didn’t learn at Codeup, but Codeup taught me how to learn so I’m learning! I feel the imposter syndrome almost every day.  I definitely felt like “What am I doing here? I have no idea what I’m doing.” Some advice I was given, and has helped me a lot, is keeping track of accomplishments you’ve done on the job. It’s great to look back on and see how much you can do and have done. Jasmine: Learn how to learn. That’s how you’re going to get ahead, and that’s something I really learned at Codeup. We couldn’t learn everything, but when you learn how to learn, you can learn anything on your own.Madeleine:  You can’t learn everything! Don’t overburden yourself with what you should or could know. Keep studying what you enjoy naturally, persist, keep practicing. It may be hard to find a job but keep practicing. Don’t undervalue networking. Madeleine: You will have technical interviews. What gets in the way for interviewers is a perceived lack of confidence. If you can’t sell yourself in that way, everything else as far as technical knowledge comes to a halt. Keep track of everything you can do as far as technical skills. Be able to fill dead air and answer questions even if you don’t know the answer. If you get to a question you don’t know, try to probe the interview to get to a mutual point that you do know. Try to slice through ambiguity, and have general conversational skills. Even if you can’t answer it directly, you can get to a point where you can elaborate on something you’re interested in tangentially, or connect with the interviewer in a different way. It could show off some other suspect of your talent, or at the very least, show confidence.Jasmine: At the end of the day, companies want to hire someone that will make a contribution. One way to show that is by doing your research on the interviewer and the company. Who are the higher-ups, who has been hired recently? Show that you are interested in them. Jasmine: Keep a spreadsheet of every single job you’ve applied to, what resume you sent them, and where you found them. Look for communities that you identify with and network with them. I am in a group for Latinx people in tech. When I’m being really targeted with looking for positions within my community, I get a better response.Madeleine: Get involved in communities! Geekdom is a great place. I am involved in the Queer community in San Antonio. You might find yourself networking in places you didn’t initially expect, but get involved, and try to be as engaged as possible. Be yourself and show your personality if you want people to remember you. Women might be expected to be more demure, or submissive in the way they present themselves. But there’s a balance between not being perceived as aggressive, and still showing that you are confident in your skills or your personality.  Jasmine: Go to a bootcamp! I was pretty self-motivated but I still wanted more of a push, more of a community, and structure. Codeup is a great way to learn how to code, but it’s not like riding a bike! You will forget how to code if you don’t code. Stay on it so you don’t fall off.Madeleine: I’m a big fan of Codecademy if you’re just trying to get your feet wet and see if you like it. For data science, Data Camp is a great resource as well. Codecadamy can also help with Codeup’s Python pre-work and challenges during the admissions process. Jasmine: In my experience, employers expect that as a Junior Developer, you’re still learning and you are going to have to learn some things on the job. They don’t expect you to know everything, but they do expect you to be willing to learn and ready to hop in. In my position, I’m learning a new programming language on the job. At Codeup, you’ll learn how to learn a language quickly, and you can take that with you for when you get hired.Madeleine: When I was at my previous company, I had to learn Deep Learning and Cybersecurity very quickly. They helped me out with getting certifications and offering stipends for learning resources. But conversely, when I wanted to grow personally in my data science skills, that was all self-taught and on my own time and from my network. Huge “thank you” to Madeleine and Jasmine for joining us as panelists for this event! They’ve offered a wide wealth of resources and experiences to grow and learn from. To recap major points, learn how to learn, keep practicing, become confident in your skills, and be yourself when you network. There are plenty of female coders out there, and plenty of communities to join to meet like-minded women. Here in Texas, Women Who Code has communities in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. In San Antonio, check out Geekdom (a coworking space for all) and this Meetup community for women developers.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-went-from-codeup-to-business-owner/,How I Went From Codeup to Business Owner - Codeup,"Apr 30, 2021 | Alumni StoriesOut of college, I was a bit of a mess. That’s what I would have told you, anyway. On the surface, I was put together. I graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 in Molecular Biology, had professor recommendations under my belt, and a clear goal to apply for a PhD program in Clinical Psychology.But as I sat in the dry Colorado sunshine on graduation day, this thought popped into my head: “I never have to go to school EVER again…” As soon as I crossed the finish line, it nauseated me to think about going back to school right away. But I felt lost. If I wasn’t going to graduate school, I didn’t have a plan anymore. What the hell was I supposed to do? Being naive and idealistic, I considered applying to the Peace Corps. My brother-in-law (bless his heart) sat me down and explained that the beginning of my career was critical. He also mentioned that it takes about a year to save up for a year of not working; otherwise, I’d have to keep depending on my parents who had already supported me through college. Being bratty and unaware of how the world works, I rolled my eyes at his perfectly logical explanations, convinced he was obsessed with making money. I sat on my high horse, lauding myself for being willing to make a sacrifice when I literally had nothing to my name. In reality, I felt lost. I didn’t recognize it at the time, but going to the Peace Corps was an excuse to run away from uncertainty. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life, and I also had these lofty dreams of maybe starting my own business one day or being a part of a movement that mattered. Sensing these hopes in me, my brother-in-law mentioned he had seen billboards around town for a coding bootcamp named Codeup. If I didn’t know what I wanted to “do”, then maybe I could build my skillset instead. My interest was piqued. Coding seemed cool. I pictured savvy devs in cute plaid shirts and man buns, and being able to live the #vanlife and become a digital nomad. (are you noticing my habit of being idealistic yet?). Buoyed by this vision, I jumped all-in. I told myself I’d go to every happy hour, mixer, network like crazy, and bond with every single one of my classmates. It worked. I landed a job in software development at a cloud security company in Dallas. After spending a year in the Engineering department of my company, I had finally come to face the reality that I wasn’t very good at coding. More importantly, I was pretty apathetic about mastering it. If I continued down my career path as a developer, I’d have to keep learning and keeping up with the latest trends in development, and nothing in me felt excited about that. I was given an opportunity to join the Marketing department as a Digital Marketing Manager. At first, I felt guilty for even considering it. Did my parents spend their hard-earned money putting me through Codeup, only for me to give it all up because I was bored? It seemed like a sin straight out of the immigrant rulebook. My dream to love what I do was “selfish” and having a sense of purpose was a “luxury”. Eventually though, I braced myself and took the leap.It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I finally felt like I was “with my people”, a collection of brainy empaths with crazy ideas. I learned so much about marketing in general, which allowed me to start up my side business as a coach. I launched my first group coaching course in 2020, and I’m writing a book to release at the start of 2022. I’m living my dream every day, learning and growing with exciting things at every turn. I’ve connected with other coaches, and built a supportive web of connections across the globe. I can’t believe how far I’ve come. But I couldn’t have done it without first building my skills. In a world that penalizes people for not fitting into a neat career category, it can sometimes get confusing for people who have lots of interests. But I realized I didn’t get here by trying to become a business owner or learn about marketing. I was just, A, open to the opportunity, and B, perfectly positioned to do so. Going through Codeup was a huge incentive for the Marketing manager to hire me, despite the fact I had ZERO marketing experience. They figured, hey, if she can learn full-stack in four months, she can definitely learn the lay of the land in marketing. My exposure to marketing gave me the necessary courage and skills to start getting my content out there. I was writing blogs, publishing podcasts, and releasing YouTube videos.With a clear mission and vision in mind, everything fell into place. It’s not that I suddenly have everything figured out; instead, I’ve gotten used to the uncertainty. I no longer worry about what my career is going to be. I know it’s not going to be “one thing”. I won’t be a coder, a writer, or a coach. I’ll be a coder-writer-coach-podcaster-marketer-salesperson-youtuber-novelist. Why choose, when I know I can make money from my unique mix of skills? Society often suggests we have to choose. But I refuse to believe that anymore. If you’re reading this and you’re uncertain about where you’re headed, it’s okay not to have all the answers. Take things day by day. Build your skillset. Follow what you love. Aim for mastery. And don’t rule out the 9-to-5 doing something you may not love. Your job doesn’t have to be your passion. A steady paycheck does wonders for anxiety and allows you to be creative and innovate in your side-hustles. Practice gratitude. Realize that, yes, things could be worse, but they can also be better. Be patient with learning to wobble on the thin line stretched between “This is enough” and “I wonder what would happen if…”Go down the rabbit holes. Be curious. And realize that life is about embracing the possibilities.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/why-you-need-the-best-coding-bootcamp-instructors/,Why You Need the Best Coding Bootcamp Instructors - Codeup,"May 21, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsOne of the many reasons students love Codeup is our focus on people. With live interaction every day, the best coding bootcamp instructors empower each student to change their life. Many try learning a new skill with free modules or self-paced courses to save money, but when you lack that human guidance, what happens when you don’t know what to learn next? What happens when you need more explaining or can’t figure out what you did wrong? What if you lose motivation and start to give up? Live, expert, personalized instruction is what will get you through the hard times and to a new career.If you’re serious about changing careers, you gotta have a good instructor. It needs to be a live, responsive instructor with industry experience, that knows how to teach you what you need to know. You’ll need a curriculum that will actually get you your desired job, based on hands-on practice and skill-building rather than theory. It should cover the entire data science pipeline or app development process to prepare you for the work you will do in-field. The classroom size must be small enough so that you get the individualized attention you deserve. Instructors need to be as invested as you are in setting you up for a successful career and motivate you if you start to give up.Luckily, you can find the best of the best instructors at Codeup. They range in industry experience from entry-level to senior-level. However, even those that are more entry-level may be senior-level educators or senior-level in a particular topic of the curriculum. With a diverse staff of instructors that all shine in different areas of expertise, you’ll have a built-out team that can provide the most value and mentorship to you. Better a full team of experts than a jack of all trades but master of none.Not only will you have expert instructors, but they also really care about you. In college, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. At other bootcamps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live, interactive lecture and lab. However, Codeup instructors are like personal mentors. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you an answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change. Feel ready to make a career change with a team of mentors to help guide you through it? Your mentor instructors will make sure you understand everything, are there when you reach a roadblock, and will keep you accountable to your learning with project-based assignments on a curriculum inspired by employers.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-speech-pathology-to-business-intelligence/,From Speech Pathology to Business Intelligence - Codeup,"Oct 18, 2021 | Alumni StoriesBy: Alicia GonzalezBefore Codeup, I was a home health Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant. I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.Then one day as I was on my way to a patient’s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said “drive to a job you love” and I took it as a sign. I thought, “I want to drive to a job I love!” I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.At first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn’t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.It was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, “okay this IS what I wanted to be doing.” I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.Overall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn’t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.Now after graduating from Codeup, I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I’ve been here almost three months now and I’m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I’m doing and how far I’ve come since working here. I didn’t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don’t teach. It’s been really good.I’m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I’m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I’m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I’m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn’t change a thing.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/how-to-hire-for-the-long-haul/,How to Hire for the Long Haul; We've Got Your Back - Codeup,"Apr 1, 2021 | Codeup News, EmployersWe’re preaching to the choir to say that recruiting, hiring, and training employees costs companies a lot of time, energy, and money. Similarly, losing existing employees causes incalculable losses on institutional knowledge and team morale. Given that 71% of recent college grads leave their first job within their first year, modern employers face a crisis of confidence in hiring employees who are ready to commit. Fortunately, you can hire for the long haul with Codeup candidates that are ready to commit to growing in your company.The average tenure of Codeup graduates in their first job is 22 months (2014-2019), almost double the norm for college grads. That means that for every Codeup grad you hire and employ, you would have to hire and employ TWO college graduates, resulting in more than double your HR costs.53% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are STILL employed at their first company. That means for more than half of your hires, you could hire an employee who sticks with you indefinitely. Between 2014-2021, 90% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are still employed in their fields of study. More broadly, most people change jobs 12 times throughout their career. You could hire someone who’s about to make 3 more career hops, or you could hire someone who is 9 times out of 10 landing in their final career change.Employers face a shifting workforce with shorter tenure, more job hopping, and less company loyalty, all of which add up to increased costs and decreased performance. Why do Codeup grads differ so drastically?Save recruitment costs, increase employee tenure, and hire employees who want to join you for the long haul. Ready to hire for the long haul?

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/know-who-youre-hiring/,Do You Know Who You're Hiring? - Codeup,"Mar 23, 2021 | Codeup News, Employers When you hire from Codeup, you know who you’re hiring. Is it a Senior Developer with experience in CI/CD and streaming over web sockets? Nope. But you are consistently getting a developer who has 670+ hours of full-stack development experience, pair programming skills, learning agility, professionalism, and grit. Every time. Will it always be a perfect fit? No. Even when counting cards, there are no absolutes, but you can still play a much smarter hand. On top of those baseline qualifications, you are sourcing candidates from a pool of hungry and motivated developers, in which your future CTO or Lead Developer might be floating. Our grads stay with their first company for an average of 24 months.  In an industry where roughly a 1 year tenure is the norm, that’s twice as long as most! They have been through life’s ups and downs, and they’re looking for a place to make a difference. Maybe you’re hiring your next lead, senior, or chief engineer! True, you might be hiring someone who doesn’t fit your culture or pace or tech stack or any other number of reasons employees don’t fit. You will always face risk, you know that and we know that. But when it doesn’t work out, we give you your money back. We boast an industry-first Salary Refund Guarantee: let go of a Codeup graduate within two weeks of hiring them and we will reimburse 100% of their payroll. With a best-case scenario of your next CEO and a worst case of a cash refund, are you ready to buy in? Get to know who you’re hiring at codeup.com/my-story/. If you would like to be matched with candidates (for free), email partners@codeup.com and we’ll schedule a call.

We’ve gone from a humble beginning in the middle of a coworking space called Geekdom, to now having three floors of our own in our favorite downtown building.Codeup has a campus in Dallas, classrooms in the Rackspace Castle in San Antonio, and offices in Houston and Austin. But Downtown San Antonio is where we were born and raised, and where we’ve planted our flag for our headquarters. While other Texas cities are becoming known for tech, San Antonio never has been. This is the city where we can make the biggest impact on the local tech scene. We’re supplying companies with the in-demand tech talent that has been missing locally while changing lives by launching San Antonians into these tech careers. The SA Tech District is growing downtown and the historic Vogue building is in the heart of it all! We’ve been part of that action for 7 years and in the Vogue Building for 6 of them. Changing careers is a lot of work, both on our staff and students. We want to have fun while doing it! We need an upbeat atmosphere where we can stay plugged into San Antonio and engaged in the tech scene. Steps away from the Majestic Theater, the Riverwalk, and our old home at Geekdom, our students and staff have a location to be excited about. During the pandemic, our staff doubled in size and we’ve outgrown our two floors. As we invite our staff back to working in-office, they need to be able to fit. By expanding into the second floor, our staff will have breathing room and ample space for social distancing. Our classrooms will stay on the 6th floor, where students get the best views of downtown. If you want to get plugged into the San Antonio tech scene, you’ve got options with Codeup! Launch a career in tech as a web developer, data scientist, system administrator, or cyber cloud specialist. Work in the office with us by joining our staff. Or, hire our grads.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-candidate-for-accreditation/,Announcing our Candidacy for Accreditation! - Codeup,"Jun 30, 2021 | Codeup NewsDid you know that even though we’re an independent school, we have multiple regulating bodies that verify our processes and results? For starters, we’re licensed and regulated by the Texas Workforce Commission. We’re also approved by the SAA Texas Veterans Commission to accept VA Benefits, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting. This already gives us a premier status and a trusted brand name. But there’s one missing piece that would take us to the next level: an accrediting body. Now, we’re well on our way there! We are proud to announce that, effective May 2021,  Codeup is a Candidate for Accreditation by The Middle States Association Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA-CSS), which is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (Phone: 267-284-5000).Accrediting bodies provide guidance and best practices for institutions like Codeup, and verify the quality of our education. The MSA-CSS in particular is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Getting accredited by them would allow us to establish eligibility to participate in federal Title IV student loan programs for adult students. This could be huge for our applicants, as it would significantly expand access to financial aid and allow even more people to change their lives by launching a tech career at Codeup. We would also be the first and only career accelerator with MSA-CSS accreditation in Texas. One article even states that coding bootcamps, in general, are not accredited.Currently, we are a candidate for accreditation, and not yet accredited. (Establishing candidacy is in itself a big feat, and a little bird told us our application was in the top 1% over at least the last 15 years!) Now that we’re candidates, we are actively working with the MSA-CSS to meet or exceed the requirements for accreditation. This process usually takes 18-24 months. Once approved, it would be an additional 12-18 months for Title IV acceptance, which is what would enable students to receive federal loans.As the Premier Career Accelerator in Texas, we are thrilled about this news. Adding this layer of compliance and quality assurance will significantly improve the quality of education we provide and the way that we provide it. It will help us abide by our core values of Delivering Excellence, Acting with Integrity, Cultivating Inclusive Growth, and Being Helpful. It will help us live out our mission of empowering life change on a bigger and better scale, so that we can continue to be the #1 option for Texans looking to launch a career in tech!Not familiar with Codeup?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/why-should-i-become-a-system-administrator/,Why Should I Become a System Administrator? - Codeup,"Aug 23, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWith so many tech careers in demand, why choose system administration? System administrators are a key component of their organizations. They keep the technology working smoothly and interact with people all across the company. Are you interested in understanding how computers operate? Or are you curious about tech but unsure of what specific tech career you might want? If so, read on to learn why you should become a system administrator!A system administrator has a solid foundation of the building blocks of technology. Usually a full-time employee, they are responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and troubleshooting of computer systems. They know the ins and outs of networking, operating systems, web servers, and databases. This is a great career path if:As an almost catch-all position for all things tech, you’ll get exposure to the business and analytics side of tech, computer science, technology management, infrastructure, hardware, and software. All of this variety will help you choose a specialization within system administration or even an entirely different tech career.To learn the skills required for the job, you often need to get certifications including CompTIA Network+ and Comp TIA Linux+. Thankfully, you can train for these certifications at programs like Codeup Cloud Academy with no prior experience needed. These sorts of programs provide critical hands-on practice so that you’re job-ready once you have the certifications in hand. Alumni often start out in Help Desk and Tech Support roles and quickly move up to become the System Administrator.Companies depend heavily on their computer networks and need them to be fast, reliable, and updated. As more and more companies depend on and invest in technology, more and more will rely on system administrators for this upkeep. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the employment of systems administrators to grow 4 percent from 2019 to 2029. It states:“Demand for information technology (IT) workers is high and should continue to grow as firms invest in newer, faster technology and mobile networks.” Our home base of Texas is actually the state that employs the most system administrators, with 34,410 currently employed.Ready to transition from a personally or physically taxing job to a full-time office job with benefits? Rather than working odd hours, finding people to take your shift, or working for commission, this career path will provide a solid and reliable salary with traditional office hours that allow for a great work/life balance.According to salary.com, the average salary of System Administrators in the United States is $67,448. This is the average across all levels of seniority, but of course, salaries range based on experience and location. These are the average salary ranges of System Administrators citywide, statewide, and nationally:In this career, you’ll interact with people at all levels of the organization and will need to simply explain complex topics. Good communication skills are a must! You should enjoy working with others and have great customer service skills. In addition, you’ll need to problem solve, think critically, and think quickly. When a network is down on a high-stakes day, it’s your time to shine, but you’ll need to withstand the pressure and act fast.Ready to earn a reliable salary, use your people skills, and get a skillset that many companies rely on?

The more we talked about the opportunities that lay ahead, the more excited he got. He told me something worth noting:“I wish I were young enough to do this. This field is very exciting!”In my head, I asked myself, “Why does one have to be young to want to learn something new?”It is never too late to start a new career or learn a new skill that will be very useful in the coming years. The opthamologist makes a lot of good money and has worked hard for many years to get to where he is now. He has earned his place in society without a doubt. However, it goes to show that people, no matter where they are in life or society, yearn to learn something new and exciting. Why not learn something that could potentially benefit you in the near future?If you can see the potential in learning computer programming and understanding technology at a deeper level, then you owe it to yourself to learn. There are many free resources online allowing you to learn and coding bootcamps that can teach you programming at a deeper level in a very short time.

https://codeup.com/why-should-you-become-a-web-developer/,Why Should You Become a Web Developer? - Codeup,"Jan 25, 2021 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentThere are some things we all look for in a career. Job security, good compensation, work/life balance, personal fulfillment – all of these can be found in a career as a developer! There’s lots of demand for them, but not nearly enough of them. Despite stereotypes, web developers can actually find their work very engaging and personally rewarding, and the world certainly needs them. It’s a solid career path, with room for growth – both personal and professional. Keep reading to learn why you should become a web developer! The demand for web developers is ever increasing. There are currently about 1,504,895 developer jobs, and 250,000 of them remain open. The 10-year growth predicted in 2019 was 8%, a rate that’s much faster than the average for all occupations. But the talent pool isn’t keeping up. In fact, Codeup was founded in 2013 by employers that couldn’t find the talent they needed to fill their development roles. This significant gap between supply and demand is a constant stretching from Silicon Valley to New York City, and probably further. For anything you need or need to know, your first touchpoint is the internet. We’ve ditched physical dictionaries and encyclopedias in favor of a Google search. Friendships and networking now exist online, and the activity of “going shopping” has been replaced with e-commerce for everything from electronics, to clothing, to education, even groceries (HEB has been dethroned by Amazon). This stark technical shift isn’t going to go away, especially now that companies have been forced to adapt to doing business online. Every company needs an interactive website with an equally interactive mobile version to stay afloat. While traditionally brick and mortar companies remove storefronts and go paperless, human-facing staff are being downsized in favor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automatic, responsive applications (think salespeople and customer service agents). However, they will always need people to program that AI, code the applications, and protect all the new networks and infrastructure from being hacked. Job security is one thing you won’t have to worry much about as a skilled developer. There truly are not enough in the market, and you can help bridge that gap while also building a fulfilling career! Reason #2 of why you should become a web developer is to have the security and stability you’ve always wanted. As mentioned earlier, the ever-growing need for developers will ensure your job security for years to come, so long as you stay up to date with the newest languages (more on that later). It’s no secret that landing your first developer job is going to be tough. That’s true whether you’re a Computer Science grad, a bootcamp grad, or self-taught. (Codeup does everything we can to streamline your job hunt.) But once you’re in, you will rarely find yourself out of a job. Web developers boast a tiny unemployment rate of 2.5%. That feeling of knowing your skillset will be in demand well into the future is priceless. It’s a career, not a job, and your compensation and benefits will reflect such. Gone are the days of clocking in and out for bathroom breaks, not seeing your family, being called in, and asking to work overtime to get more hours. Welcome to the days of a stable and flexible work schedule, health insurance, retirement contributions, and a good salary! The average starting salaries are:Those are some good looking numbers for your very first development job. And salary offers drastically increase after you pass “entry level.” Average salaries are:Senior Web Developers have at least 5 years of experience, but some companies require more. Even still, there’s potential to nearly double your salary in just a couple years. A few years more and six figures, here you come! Look, coding is tough stuff! You can equate it to learning Spanish, then German, then all of a sudden, French is all the rage. Meanwhile, your colleagues may speak it a little differently than you, using a different word order to deliver the same message. This career path is one of continuous learning and evolution:This career path is for highly motivated individuals that are okay with constant learning, shifting, and growth. Job satisfaction is an ambiguous thing to measure. Some things that go into it are job security, compensation, ability to grow, and personal fulfillment, all of which we touch on here. Other elements are work/life balance, quality of leadership, colleagues, and appreciation from others, which vary from person to person and from job to job. You’ll be happy to know that the majority of developers, at a whopping 63%, are satisfied with their jobs. (That’s much higher than the national average of 51%!) Lots of developers think of their job as a hobby, like mastering an instrument or a sport. It can be very personally fulfilling. For some, they’re creative and innovative. They enjoy being at the forefront of tech and bringing ideas to life. It’s an exciting place to be! Others fully embrace their analytical skills, and love the idea of seeing performance results whenever they run their code. If it runs, fabulous. If it doesn’t, it’s a problem they enjoy solving. Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes. Is it also very rewarding when it finally works the way they intend? Absolutely. Thinking more externally, can the applications you make truly make a difference in someone’s life? Definitely! When you’re a web developer working with the right team toward the right mission, you might love it so much you’d do it for free (hypothetically, of course). So why should you become a web developer? It’s a solid career path with high compensation and high demand that will grant you the stability, security, and confidence we all long for. Going one step further, you can meet your full potential in a position with constant growth and high job satisfaction, where creative minds can embrace their creativity and analytical minds can embrace their problem-solving skills. Feel fulfilled, confident, accomplished, and secure. Start today, be a web developer in 6 months! Apply now!

https://codeup.com/why-you-should-become-a-data-scientist/,Why You Should Become a Data Scientist - Codeup,"Mar 11, 2021 | Data ScienceWhat do you look for in a career? Chances are, you’re looking for a way to make use of your particular talents, a field that’s secure and reliable, a work/life balance, and good compensation. For the right people, data science offers all of that and more! It was LinkedIn’s #1 Most Promising Job in 2019, and Glassdoor’s 2nd Best Job of 2021! Actually, Data Scientists topped that list from 2016 to 2019 before being dethroned by developers, which we also train at Codeup. So why all the hype? What makes it the best? Keep reading to learn why you should become a Data Scientist! Do your colleagues hate you for overanalyzing things? Have you found yourself turning everything into a spreadsheet? Do you make your life decisions based on careful calculations using past data? You might thrive as a data scientist! This is the first section on our list because data science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider where your strengths and interests actually lie. If you don’t have a penchant for numbers and historical patterns, or if careful analysis bores you, this may not be for you. For some people, though, data science is fascinating, rewarding, and a great way to make use of their talents and natural thought processes. Check out how much our students love what they do every week in this blog post.  The field is booming, the demand is high, and the job is the best. 2020 was the first year since 2016 that Data Scientist was not the number one job in America, according to Glassdoor. Now it sits at Number 2, but rest assured, the growth and demand show no signs of slowing down. Since 2012, there has been a 650% increase in data science positions. However, the supply of data scientists remains relatively low. Sure, it’s been the number 1 job for a while now and people are catching on, but more and more positions are also opening, so supply isn’t actually catching up to the demand. At least, for qualified data scientists.One reason for the continued low supply is that prospective data scientists who go traditional routes are often stuck in school for 2-4 years. Meanwhile, the demands and technologies are changing rapidly, so what they are learning risks being outdated by the time they graduate. Another reason is that a Master’s Degree does not in and of itself prepare grads with the skills needed for the job, or even just to nail their technical interviews. They might learn about data science for years, but if they don’t practice it, don’t have a repository that they push to regularly, haven’t built a data pipeline, don’t have project experience, etc., they aren’t ready to work as a data scientist. This lack of post-grad readiness is another contributor to the low supply, despite many graduate students thinking they’re ready for the job search. (Thinking of getting a Master’s Degree? Learn more, here.) Altogether, this makes a trained data scientist all the more valuable, relatively rare, and in very high demand.So, you know that demand is high now and that properly qualified data scientists (with flexible demands) will have no trouble finding a job. But you don’t just want a job now, you want a career for the long haul. Is this just a trend that’s going to fizzle out? Unlikely. Will this still be a secure path in the future, say 10 or 20 years down the road? All the data say yes!The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists Data Scientists as one of the fastest-growing occupations. They project a 31% growth rate with nearly 12 million new jobs between 2019 and 2029. More and more companies will have no choice but to start using data-driven decision making, lest they risk being put out of business by their data savvy competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of data science, alone is creating millions of jobs! However, it’s also wiping out over a million jobs. Want to make sure your skillset stays in-demand? Start a career with job security. Employers will always need humans to program the machines, understand the data pipeline, write the algorithms used by AI, and continue maintaining the tech and the data.Many of Codeup’s career transitioners know what it’s like to work in oilfields, call centers, food service, sales, retail, and teaching. The ones that don’t require manual labor or being on your feet all day still require odd hours, lots of emotional exertion, or giving up weekends. Some people love this sort of work, but others are missing that work/life balance. Work/life balance is something that’s completely subjective based on where you are in your life, how much you enjoy your work, how much is required of you, and so on.With a career in tech, you will very likely be working at a desk from 8 or 9am to 5 or 6pm with weekends off. You won’t be manual laboring, rushing to get someone to cover your shift, stressing about getting in hours, or speaking to customers or children all day long. Will some days be more stressful than others? Are you going to have to stay late sometimes to meet deadlines? Will you spend some of your “free” time learning the newest technologies? Yes. But for the most part, you can relax. You’ll have a steady work schedule, an average stress level, above-average flexibility should you need to adjust your schedule or take time off, and you will almost always have evenings and the weekends to yourself or to spend time with family and friends.Interested in boosting your earning potential? Data science is a lucrative field with a highly valuable skillset. You could potentially double your current salary with your very first in-field job. Your employer might also cover health insurance, provide retirement contributions, and offer flexible paid time off. Entry-level data scientists have some of the highest starting salaries around, with averages of:And it’s only upward from there as your career progresses. In San Antonio, which is where our headquarters are, we’re seeing salary averages of:Want to start earning six figures within a few years? Become a data scientist. With just a few years of experience, your talent becomes much more valuable. Keep reading to see how long it takes to advance.In the tech field, room for growth is limitless. There are always new technologies to learn and adapt to, new skills to perfect along the data pipeline, and career opportunities abound. The next step after beginning your career as a Junior Data Scientist is often Senior Data Scientist, which is the middle level. Typically, this requires 3-5 years of relevant work experience and the abilities to write reusable code, formulate machine learning algorithms, and build strong data pipelines in cloud environments. After senior is the top level, the most experienced member of the data science team. You may see them referred to with different titles, such as Vice President, Director, Head, or Chief. They lead the data science team, have over 5 years of experience, and are fluent or very well-versed along the data science pipeline. This person knows best practices for building and deploying a predictive model, can efficiently write code, and will know the highest impact projects to work on (TowardsDataScience). So, you’ve got a booming industry, a secure field, a skill set that’s in high demand, the ability to advance your career, a lucrative salary, a solid work/life balance, and to top it off, you get to do what you’re good at and passionate about. No wonder it’s the best job out there! If you enjoy working with data, this could be an incredibly fulfilling career path. Did you know it only takes 6 months to actually become a data scientist?

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-career/,What Data Science Career is For You? - Codeup Data Science,"Sep 16, 2020 | Data ScienceIf you’re struggling to see yourself as a data science professional, it may be because the field of data science can be rather broad. While many positions in data science work across the entire data science pipeline, some are more active in a particular area. Codeup prepares you to take any number of data science career paths throughout this pipeline. To help explain the differences, we’ll discuss where some of our alumni have ended up. Keep reading to see what appeals to you!First up is the data portion of the data science pipeline, where we plan and acquire the data. Business Analysts like Jesse Ruiz and Jeff Hutchins, as well as People Analytics Specialists like Tim Sotirhos help their companies or departments identify what questions need to be answered, and what data they need to answer those questions. This often involves researching or reviewing existing processes and strategizing how they can be improved. They may work closely with project managers to create an action plan.Then, in the information portion, we process and prepare the data for future exploration.Data Analysts like Matthew Zapata aggregate and manage, that is, combine, process, prepare, and store, the data for easy access. They research and improve on data quality and safeguard against data loss or errors. They also explore the data for potential relationships between variables, usefulness, and outliers. Data Analysts may also acquire the data and/or analyze the data for potential insights, but typically do not build and deploy machine learning models.In the knowledge portion, data is analyzed and turned into meaningful statisticsThis stage is typically combined with Information or Intelligence rather than existing on its own. In a given company, their Data Analysts may both prepare and explore data, or the Machine Learning Engineers will both explore and model the data. Data Scientists, the broadest career in data science, typically will do all three, like Ednalyn De Dios. Unlike other data professionals (unless otherwise trained), Data Scientists can work anywhere along this continuum. Once we have that knowledge, we use the intelligence stage to turn it into future predictions with machine learning models.When the data is ready, Machine Learning Engineers like Michael Moran and Eric Escalante write the algorithms necessary to build, deploy, and continue to improve upon machine learning models. A machine learning model is a file that uses an algorithm to identify patterns and trends from data.Decision Science Analysts, like Jeff Roeder, use math, stats, and machine learning models to convert intelligence-driven insights to actionable recommendations. They answer the questions asked by Business Analysts earlier in the timeline to draw conclusions for their company.Finally, the action stage lets us integrate these insights into tests, then continue to monitor and evaluate new data.Security Data Analysts like Sara Pena need to be able to identify trends from automated models that they or someone else created. They meet with stakeholders to discuss their analysis and help develop tests and prototypes of their recommendations. They then own and execute projects related to continuous improvement of their company’s processes.It’s totally possible for YOU to take on any of these job titles! Maybe it’s time to explore these careers even further, especially if one excited you. While Codeup does prepare and train Data Scientists, you may find your niche and prefer one stage to another.

It's been a year since then, and I am still with the same company.Experience before Codeup: I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I did a year of Comp Sci classes at university before I dropped out to go to Codeup. Before Codeup I was an Assistant Manager at a major clothing brand. Cost: I only had to pay the deposit of ~$1000-$1500. The rest was covered by a city grant and a 'women in tech' scholarship.  Overall Experience:Life-changing. I can confidently say that Codeup did more for me than years of the university did. I was reluctant at first until I looked up their job placement statistics. 87%! Numbers don't lie. It is a risk for sure, but the incredible payoff is worth it. I would not be at my current job if not for Codeup. Instructors: You're taught by several different instructors throughout the course. It's nice because if you don't vibe with one instructor, it won't be forever. It's not for you if you expect the instructors to give you all the answers. You wouldn't expect your manager to give you all the answers!  Curriculum:The curriculum is something that anyone can learn on their own. The difference is that Codeup provides structure and context. The level of difficulty depends on your prior experience. It is quite intense, with a fast learning pace. With dedication, anyone can do it. There are student-led study sessions and instructor-provided tutoring. Codeup is very good at teaching you the most important aspects of a language or technology and leaving the rest up to you. They give you a great learning foundation and you learn HOW to learn. As a developer, you never stop learning, so this is a great skill to have! Job Assistance: The job assistance is extensive and extremely helpful. This is the best part of Codeup in my opinion. There is job placement staff that assist you throughout the process. Your resume is viewed and critiqued several times. You will have mock interviews. You will design your own personal website. Your LinkedIn will be critiqued.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate. 100% of students intended to seek in-field employment within 180 days of graduating. 0% of students did not intend to seek in-field employment.Below is the 180 Day Employment Breakdown for 56 graduates included in report: Dallas, San AntonioCertified as a Career School through the Texas Workforce Commission.

His first class is now out in the workforce and the second full class is now in session.""You know, it's an embryonic industry here,"" Girdley said.

CodeUp was no exception.Its CEO, Jason Straughan, said the change has been a silver living as it has opened up more possibilities for students in tech.“Before (the pandemic) happened, you had to move to San Antonio or Dallas and be physically in one of our campuses to be able to come and experience CodeUp,” Straughan said. “Now, we are offering our remote program anywhere inside the State of Texas.”In a time where the world shut down and some industries suffered tremendously due to the pandemic, Tommy Cirilo-Thorpe’s career was barely beginning to develop.“I enrolled early in May,” Cirilo-Thorpe said. “My main focus is a full stack (web) development.”The virtual program is one of two offered at CodeUp.“This is an industry that embraced remote work a decade or more ago, and so, it was easier for us to transition than maybe some other educational institutions,” Straughan said.The second program offered is in data science.“Both of them are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday for 22 weeks,” Straughan said. “It’s a very intense program.”Cirilo-Thorpe, now graduate of CodeUp, said the online courses offered flexibility, but most importantly, the knowledge and foundation needed to land a job within six months of graduation.“As a full stock developer, we can basically create web applications or websites or programs from scratch or edit something that’s already there or maintain it,” Cirilo-Thorpe said. “Thanks to our admissions team, I was introduced to a gentleman who works at this company called Cognizant. It’s a Fortune 200 company.”The graduate was hired on as an intern and is expected to be brought onto the team full-time in the Spring of 2021, providing peace of mind for him and his wife.“Our web development students enjoyed around $45,000 in a median starting salary and our data science students it was almost (in the) $70,000 range,” Straughan said.CodeUp is now officially certified by the State of Texas to offer online classes.

It also has offices in Houston and Austin, offering online training programs in those cities. The Cloud Academy (now called the Codeup Cloud Academy) will expand the school into Rackspace’s windcrest headquarters. The deal comes with a lease of the Cloud Academy’s facility there.It will add 80 percent more classroom space for Codeup across the state and double it locally. Straughan said it might be the most exciting thing they’ve done since they were founded, and it should help achieve their main goal.“We have a ten year goal to be the number one place in Texas to enter a career in technology,” he explained.The current plan is to continue the cloud academy’s offerings unabated. The purchase marries the systems administration and the cyber security curriculum of the cloud academy with the web development and data science programs of Codeup. The two organizations in the past have shared that goal, to fill desperately needed technology roles across the state.That’s how the two different programs were born within a year of each other. Codeup was founded in 2014 by Straughan, Michael Girdley, and Chris Turner — trying to fill open stack web developer positions their companies had. The Open Cloud Academy was founded the year before by Rackspace to fill the rapidly growing company’s positions.""Codeup merging with Rackspace Cloud will make them even more compelling to San Antonians (who want) to enter tech careers,"" said Graham Weston in a text. Weston, the former CEO of Rackspace, said that the Cloud Academy has changed lives.Like Codeup, the main selling point is an education that can net them a high(er) paying gig.In the early days of the Cloud Academy, when they were still in the Weston Center downtown, then director Deborah Carter says they had ordered pizza for the classes. The pizza delivery guy inquired about the program and would join a later training course.“Then many years later after he got a job, he sent me an email saying he had bought his first house,” she said.Carter credits Weston for his vision.“I am really excited that OCA (Open Cloud Academy) is going to continue to thrive with local leadership,” she said.The future of the Cloud Academy has been anything but certain over the years. The school was first started as a way to fill the hyperspeed growth at Rackspace. But that growth fell off. Carter said they always anticipated having to pivot other employers, and successfully did so.But in 2016 Rackspace sold to private equity giant Apollo Global Management.In arrangements like that, it isn’t unreasonable to see non-core functions cut. But while the company saw lean times, cutting as much as six percent of its staff, the school continued largely unaffected in downtown. The question always present: Would the Cloud Academy be part of Rackspace long-term?Rackspace has gone through a number of changes and pivots to everything from leadership to ownership — the company went public again last August. The Open Cloud Academy remained, and was even invested in.Rackspace renamed it the Rackspace Cloud Academy last June, expanded its training, and gave it a new home in the Windcrest corporate headquarters.Rackspace Technology was not immediately available for comment. Now, the two companies and training programs are one. The acquisition pushes Codeup’s total graduate numbers up around 30% per year.The jobs remain in demand with cyber security positions growing by 31%, according to the bureau of labor statistics. They are also high paying, something one of the poorest big cities in the country can’t get enough of.TPR was founded by and is supported by our community.

https://codeup.com/web-development/why-should-you-become-a-web-developer/,Why Should You Become a Web Developer? - Codeup,"Jan 25, 2021 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentThere are some things we all look for in a career. Job security, good compensation, work/life balance, personal fulfillment – all of these can be found in a career as a developer! There’s lots of demand for them, but not nearly enough of them. Despite stereotypes, web developers can actually find their work very engaging and personally rewarding, and the world certainly needs them. It’s a solid career path, with room for growth – both personal and professional. Keep reading to learn why you should become a web developer! The demand for web developers is ever increasing. There are currently about 1,504,895 developer jobs, and 250,000 of them remain open. The 10-year growth predicted in 2019 was 8%, a rate that’s much faster than the average for all occupations. But the talent pool isn’t keeping up. In fact, Codeup was founded in 2013 by employers that couldn’t find the talent they needed to fill their development roles. This significant gap between supply and demand is a constant stretching from Silicon Valley to New York City, and probably further. For anything you need or need to know, your first touchpoint is the internet. We’ve ditched physical dictionaries and encyclopedias in favor of a Google search. Friendships and networking now exist online, and the activity of “going shopping” has been replaced with e-commerce for everything from electronics, to clothing, to education, even groceries (HEB has been dethroned by Amazon). This stark technical shift isn’t going to go away, especially now that companies have been forced to adapt to doing business online. Every company needs an interactive website with an equally interactive mobile version to stay afloat. While traditionally brick and mortar companies remove storefronts and go paperless, human-facing staff are being downsized in favor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automatic, responsive applications (think salespeople and customer service agents). However, they will always need people to program that AI, code the applications, and protect all the new networks and infrastructure from being hacked. Job security is one thing you won’t have to worry much about as a skilled developer. There truly are not enough in the market, and you can help bridge that gap while also building a fulfilling career! Reason #2 of why you should become a web developer is to have the security and stability you’ve always wanted. As mentioned earlier, the ever-growing need for developers will ensure your job security for years to come, so long as you stay up to date with the newest languages (more on that later). It’s no secret that landing your first developer job is going to be tough. That’s true whether you’re a Computer Science grad, a bootcamp grad, or self-taught. (Codeup does everything we can to streamline your job hunt.) But once you’re in, you will rarely find yourself out of a job. Web developers boast a tiny unemployment rate of 2.5%. That feeling of knowing your skillset will be in demand well into the future is priceless. It’s a career, not a job, and your compensation and benefits will reflect such. Gone are the days of clocking in and out for bathroom breaks, not seeing your family, being called in, and asking to work overtime to get more hours. Welcome to the days of a stable and flexible work schedule, health insurance, retirement contributions, and a good salary! The average starting salaries are:Those are some good looking numbers for your very first development job. And salary offers drastically increase after you pass “entry level.” Average salaries are:Senior Web Developers have at least 5 years of experience, but some companies require more. Even still, there’s potential to nearly double your salary in just a couple years. A few years more and six figures, here you come! Look, coding is tough stuff! You can equate it to learning Spanish, then German, then all of a sudden, French is all the rage. Meanwhile, your colleagues may speak it a little differently than you, using a different word order to deliver the same message. This career path is one of continuous learning and evolution:This career path is for highly motivated individuals that are okay with constant learning, shifting, and growth. Job satisfaction is an ambiguous thing to measure. Some things that go into it are job security, compensation, ability to grow, and personal fulfillment, all of which we touch on here. Other elements are work/life balance, quality of leadership, colleagues, and appreciation from others, which vary from person to person and from job to job. You’ll be happy to know that the majority of developers, at a whopping 63%, are satisfied with their jobs. (That’s much higher than the national average of 51%!) Lots of developers think of their job as a hobby, like mastering an instrument or a sport. It can be very personally fulfilling. For some, they’re creative and innovative. They enjoy being at the forefront of tech and bringing ideas to life. It’s an exciting place to be! Others fully embrace their analytical skills, and love the idea of seeing performance results whenever they run their code. If it runs, fabulous. If it doesn’t, it’s a problem they enjoy solving. Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes. Is it also very rewarding when it finally works the way they intend? Absolutely. Thinking more externally, can the applications you make truly make a difference in someone’s life? Definitely! When you’re a web developer working with the right team toward the right mission, you might love it so much you’d do it for free (hypothetically, of course). So why should you become a web developer? It’s a solid career path with high compensation and high demand that will grant you the stability, security, and confidence we all long for. Going one step further, you can meet your full potential in a position with constant growth and high job satisfaction, where creative minds can embrace their creativity and analytical minds can embrace their problem-solving skills. Feel fulfilled, confident, accomplished, and secure. Start today, be a web developer in 6 months! Apply now!

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/styling-hair-stying-interfaces/,From Styling Hair to Stying Interfaces - Codeup,"Nov 7, 2018 | Alumni Stories, Behind the BillboardsBy Sukari SchutzmanI grew up loving technology. I still remember thinking that my grandmothers’ flip phone in 1995 was the coolest thing I had ever seen. As a child, I took all my electronic toys apart, because I was curious what was inside. So you can say, I always yearned for a career in tech.My name is Sukari Schutzman. I don’t take myself too seriously, I’m always laughing, and trying to share positive energy, but most importantly I am a software developer.When I got my cosmetology license, I was passionate about doing hair. I wanted to learn how to be better, and how to perfect my craft. In many ways, I see a lot of parallels in cosmetology, and in software development. Drawing those parallels kept me strong in the program and reminded me to never give up. I remembered when I was in cosmetology school, or when I was in the salon and I was stuck on something, I always asked for help. In software development and at Codeup, the same rings true.I had always driven by the billboards on I-10 on my way into San Antonio and was ALWAYS confused. “Software Developer? Why is ‘Retail Manager’ crossed out? What is that?”, I always wondered. But I always continued to drive on and thought nothing of it when I reached my destination.I decided development was for me and wanted to transition into it and learn how to code, as I had been exposed to it for a while. I knew self-study would not work for me. I needed to be in a classroom and knew I needed to be in front of an instructor. But most importantly, I needed a job ASAP because I needed to support myself and my child.When I arrived at Codeup and went on the tour I was amazed. I knew this would be the place for me, and it was going to be where I knew my life would change. I was going to be walking out of one door and into another. And I wasn’t going to look back.When I found out that I had got in, I was so happy that my hard work paid off and I knew it was just the beginning of what was to come. I looked forward to the start date and marked it on my calendar. I also quit my job, which was much needed because salon life was stressful enough, let alone learning a new skill.The next few months were filled with triumphs and failures, which is normal in any career. No one is born good at everything, it takes practice and determination (I totally had to repeat that to myself every single day at Codeup. Thanks Ryan!). Sometimes it felt like two steps back, but I was determined to make it to Demo Day and present my Capstone.With the help of Codeup staff, I felt set up to succeed at Demo Day. But most of all, I felt prepared for my new career.Demo Day finally came! Our project got the most compliments on the visual interface, which I worked hard on, and helped us stand out amongst our classmates. I had a few interviews set up for within a week after Demo Day and landed my first job. At this point, I was in awe. Everything I worked hard for had finally came to fruition. And most of all, I didn’t have to work weekends unless I wanted to.There’s nothing wrong with being a hairstylist, absolutely not! However, it just wasn’t for me anymore. Thanks to Codeup, my life is so different now.And for that, I am eternally grateful.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-cooking-steaks-to-cooking-code/,From Cooking Steaks To Cooking Code - Codeup,"Nov 5, 2018 | Alumni Storiesby Alexander BousGrowing upIt would be an understatement to say that the bar of expectations were set high as the youngest of 4 to immigrant parents, who were also mechanical engineers. Eldest: Entrepreneur with several successful businesses; Second: Contract Law Lawyer; Third: Doctor of Neonatal Genetics; Fourth (Me): cooked since I was 15. Although the decision to make a career of cooking didn’t hit me for a few years, I had known that I did not want to follow the footsteps of my parents or siblings.CookingAt the age of 19, I decided that I wanted to attend college at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Before I could finalize my decision, I knew I had to tell my parents. They reacted just as I thought they would. “What?! NO, NEVER! Never in my life did I ever think my son would become a cook.” Our family comes from a culture where there are three acceptable career paths: Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers. Coming from a family where I already had a sibling fulfilling each of those roles, I felt that I had nothing to prove to anyone except myself. I ended up attending CIA and working in the industry for 15 years. Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what’s best for my family, and transition careers.The Most Important ThingEarly on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: “The most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.” This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don’t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? “A happy family and nothing else” is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it’s time to figure out how to get there.The First Step: Codeup Open HouseAfter spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer.The Second Step: “Good”After getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata’s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, “Good” would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of “Good” moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move.  I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. “What a relief,” I thought. It was good to know that I wasn’t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn’t do it. Finding a Job with Only Cooking ExperienceAfter graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating.Goal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain SkillsI got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it’s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, “they taught me how to learn”. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say “Good”, another opportunity to get better.[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-a-recent-college-grad-to-software-developer/,From a Recent College Grad to Software Developer - Codeup,"Sep 28, 2018 | Alumni Stories, Behind the BillboardsI take pride in my bachelor’s degree. Starting my computing career at Trinity University has proven to be extremely important; all the hours spent on algorithm design, data structures, logic are all essential in what I’m doing now. However, it is not an uncommon idea that what colleges teach can sometimes be an offset to industry demands. I experienced this significant gap between employer expectations and my computing skill-set post-college, and with the I-need-a-job-to-get-experience-to-work-for-a-job-that-requires-experience catch that most college graduates experience the first few years of leaving academia, I found myself struggling to find employment. The first year of leaving my university was a humbling yet soul-crushing experience. Why is it that I’ve pursued a degree directly related to such a hungry market for software developers, but I am unable to find a job? Among what seemed like an endless stream of interviews in which I partook, I began to notice a trend – I lacked full-stack development experience with relevant programming languages that are currently in demand. Turns out, having theoretical knowledge isn’t enough for most employers in the market. The industry of software development has evolved throughout the years of its existence, and with its evolution came new programming languages that better suit the needs of its users and the customers it will eventually serve. Ultimately, logical thinking did not trump most self-taught HTML, CSS, Javascript developers that fill the market with highly innovative ideas and projects.As a Trinity graduate who still lived in San Antonio after graduating, I learned more about Codeup from peers who contributed to the curriculum and program’s growth. Some of my classmates in my department also attended the program and found great opportunities within the industry upon graduating from the program. At first, I was skeptical of the value Codeup could bring to someone like me who already had experience in programming, albeit in languages that weren’t exactly in demand. But, being unemployed and discouraged for seemingly an eternity, I decided to give it a go.The program was an introduction to programming, which is very different from my experience in college. Since I was verbose in the structure and characteristics of software development, it was easily digestible. The curriculum consisted of introductions to different programming languages, and most importantly, showed me how everything pieced together to form working and aesthetically pleasing products that definitely had the potential to be client-facing projects that serve the public. It was an eye-opening experience for me: seeing and experiencing web development with relevant technologies like MVC, ES6, and the Spring Framework. As most of the course material was quickly grasped by my existing mode of thinking, I spent most of my time on the assignments, perfecting them and pushing myself to create difficult effects or programs. The instructors were all extremely helpful and understanding of my background, and were even nice enough to provide me with bonus assignments to push what I’ve learned to its limits.I never would have guessed that Codeup would benefit me in the way it did. Within a week of graduating, I found a job as a Salesforce Developer at a consulting company here in San Antonio. Together with the knowledge I’ve obtained from my degree, I have put everything I learned at Codeup to use: creating real products used by thousands of real users. I wouldn’t be here without the experience I had, not just with the curriculum, but with the excellent career placement staff at Codeup. As cliché as it may sound, the benefits I’ve gotten from the program that acted as supplements to my degree don’t fall far from being life-changing, and I would encourage those who have experienced the same struggles as me in this competitive market to give it a go.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-became-a-software-developer-with-codeup/,How I Became a Software Developer with Codeup - Codeup,"Jan 17, 2020 | Alumni StoriesWe spoke with one of our talented Alumni, Alex Ahrens, who just recently graduated with our Ceres web development cohort. Alex shed some light on his Codeup and coding experience, and we’re sharing his story in hopes that it helps others take one step closer to landing the career of their dreams. Let’s start with you introducing yourself; where are you from, and what was your background before Codeup?“My name is Alex, I’m not from San Antonio but have lived here on and off for most of my life. I have had a lot of random odd jobs before going to Codeup, everything from customer service, to logging, to a cruise ship deckhand, to bartender.”What made you interested in coding? And what made you decide to pull the trigger and look for ways to make it your career?“I was in Military Intelligence in the Army, and when I transitioned out, I decided to stay in intel and went to UTSA to get a CS degree to be in Cyber Security.”How did you end up coming to Codeup?“I was bottlenecked in my degree plan (required to take a few prerequisite classes before I could proceed with my degree) at UTSA and decided that I didn’t want to spend another three semesters trying to get passed those classes. Codeup cut that time significantly for a very similar outcome at a cheaper price, so that’s what I chose.”What has your experience been like here?“Very challenging, but rewarding as well. My classmates were always there for each other when we needed help and generally went out of our way to help. That along with the enormous amount of knowledge made it a difficult but enjoyable experience.”What would you tell people considering a career in software development?“Practice. Without consistent practice, it is beyond difficult to learn and just as hard to retain. Keep programming even when you don’t need to. Learning doesn’t stop when class is over or when you’re graduated. You have to constantly stick with it.” __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   Alex Ahrens is a software developer in San Antonio, TX. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Are you ready to explore the world of tech and the possibilities of a new career?

It was a great experience that made me feel right at home. Solving problems, planning, and developing projects all aligned perfectly with my passions and hobbies. Out of the 670+ hours spent developing, there were moments when I would feel the stress, frustration, and discouragement when my source code wouldn’t produce my expected outcome. However, I believed in my abilities and persevered. I continued to work diligently on every project until it was successfully complete. The hard work wasn’t easy, but it was extremely rewarding. It is commonly said, “If you love what you do, it won’t feel like work” and I truly what I love to do! I can honestly say that my career is my passion. The impact this program has had on me is unforgettable. I’ve left this program with a new career, knowledge, experience, and skills; but also friends that share the same passion as myself. It was beyond my expectations. I am extremely grateful for the friendships created, the instructors who always had time to help, and the staff that solidified this entire experience. My drive and passion have led me here and I’m eager to embark on this journey to keep learning and continue developing. Are you ready to discover your passion?

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/path-codeup-coding-bootcamps/,Finding the Perfect Coding Bootcamp Fit for Me - Codeup,"Nov 14, 2018 | Alumni Stories I looked at Codeup for 2 years before I finally made the decision to apply. As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses. The online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn’t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup’s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn’t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup’s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, “Will I get a job afterwards?”I learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers’ requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup’s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn’t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I’m doing now. My only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner.[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/codeup-alumni-make-water/,How Codeup Alumni are Helping to Make Water - Codeup,"Jul 27, 2020 | Alumni Stories, Full Stack Web DevelopmentImagine having a kit mailed to you with all the necessary components to make contaminated water clean. Cool, huh? Four of our alumni are helping to make that possible by partnering with the non-profit Elequa to design a website for their Make Water program. With this project, these Codeup alumni have the potential to make a global impact: Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller. The Make Water program inspires, educates, and equips people that want to make a tangible difference in the world. Elequa puts together DIY kits with the tools to purify water and delivers them to people that need them, locally and abroad. This project is also given to students in the San Antonio area, who in turn are challenged to research, tweak, and further develop the kits to make them better and more accessible. These problem-solving challenges engage students in the STEM field, inspiring teamwork and collaboration while making a difference that they can be proud of: helping to provide clean water.Currently, the Make Water program lacks a platform to house and share the data gathered by students to improve the kits, while also challenging other community members for further development. They needed help with the gamification of these processes to make participation more engaging. That’s where Codeup alumni Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller came in. They are helping Elequa to build an open-source application for the Make Water program that turns community participation into a game where users can level up as they contribute and collaborate through an array of real-world challenges in water research, coding, hardware innovation, and creative storytelling.Did we mention that they are working on this project as volunteers, as Codeup alumni often do? Codeup students are always looking for ways to challenge themselves, sharpen their skills, and make a difference, and that continues after graduation.

I was actively applying for law enforcement positions because that was basically all I knew. My mother called me one afternoon and mentioned Codeup. She suggested I apply for the web development course. My first thoughts were, “There’s no way I can become a REAL developer in 18 weeks and, if I get in, I won’t  be able to keep up with the curriculum.” But, there was no risk in applying, so I did. The admissions process was smooth and any questions I had were answered by Codeup staff. Then I was accepted into the web development course!The course was challenging, but every challenge felt like an opportunity to grow. Each lesson was structured and easy to follow. The instructors give real world examples and encouraged engagement through questions and ideas. The exercises had requirements, but no limits, which allows for multiple solutions and endless possibilities. As the course progressed, I knew this was for me. Towards the end of the course, the Codeup staff connected me with potential employers based on what I was looking for. Shortly after completing the course, I received an offer letter from a software company that provides data tracking software to non-profits. I love my job. I get to build cool stuff that helps make a difference in the world while growing as a Software Engineer.My advice for anyone considering Codeup is to reach out to admissions. They would be more than happy to share what Codeup is all about and answer any questions you may have. If you’ve already been accepted, you are in good hands. The staff genuinely wants you to succeed. Try your best and you will do great.Want to chat with our Admissions Team?

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/codeup-prepared-career/,How Codeup Prepared Me for a Career - Codeup,"Nov 28, 2018 | Alumni StoriesBy Joyce Yueh Yueh LingIn four months, a lot can change. Four months: A San Antonio winter, a long distance relationship, a college semester. During my four months at Codeup, I pursued what felt like an unattainable goal and actually reached it. When I tell people that I’ve been coding less than a year and am now working as a software developer, people are usually impressed. But to be frank, I could never have done that without attending a coding boot camp like Codeup. It was a short four-month process that was like stumbling from a dusty, old wardrobe into Narnia: on one side, a clumsy and unenlightened beginner and thereafter being transformed by a completely new and fantastical world. Attending Codeup armed me with the experience and knowledge that allowed me to survive the harsh winter landscape that starting out from scratch as a software developer can be. Now as I am working at my first real job, I’m grateful to Codeup for teaching me several things that allowed me to be better prepared for my career.From beginning to end, Codeup placed a huge emphasis on group exercises. The beginning of the course was characterized by paired programming, a process in which one person is the navigator and one is the driver. As the names suggest, the navigator communicates with the person at the keyboard and directs them to type certain bits of code or navigate to specific elements on the page. Often, we would flip-flop between these roles so both students could get a crack at practicing one of two things: Firstly, we practiced how to communicate clearly and efficiently. Secondly, we learned how to take direction and ask clarifying questions. At the time, I wasn’t sure what the big deal was with paired programming and why the instructors at Codeup had made it such an integral part of the curriculum. However, as I go about my everyday duties at work, I realized how often I engage in informal bouts of paired programming. Although we have a Wikipedia-style knowledge base at my work where we document our processes, a lot of knowledge is still transferred orally (not ideal, but we’re working on it!). What this means is that paired programming happens on a daily basis. If a developer is having a complex problem, it is usually easier for a coworker who has solved this problem before to sit down and walk them through it rather than try to explain things via chat or email.Towards the end of the semester, we coalesced into group projects in which the primary focus was teamwork. This was where we got a taste of working independently but in a team effort. It was during the group projects that I discovered the importance of learning how to use a versioning control system, such as GitHub, that allowed multiple developers to participate on the same project without stepping on any toes. When I started my job at Armor, I realized how much more complex versioning control can get when you have potentially 50+ people contributing to the same repository at any given time. I had to relearn the fundamentals and be extra careful not to overwrite someone else’s work. Most mistakes are reversible, but the headache of figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it is usually a source of distraction from a developer’s daily duties and sprint goals.When I initially started at Codeup, I found myself wanting to ask the instructors questions as soon as I got stuck on something. However, I quickly realized that their resources were limited since there were only 2 of them (plus 1-2 fellows) in a class of 30. Although this wasn’t ideal, it actually did simulate a real-life scenario that parallels a professional working environment. At my work, there are probably only 2 or 3 lead developers. However,  they are constantly inundated with requests by QE and other junior developers, code review, and demands from management. If you need to make a request, best make it quick and efficient. I then remembered what instructors had mentioned during Codeup. They taught us that if you have a question, make sure you present it in a format such as:This made it so that students would actually try to figure out a solution before shooting their hand up every time they had a problem, only to find that they could have easily solved it with a little more digging. In my experience, most experienced developers are usually happy to help. However, it’s good practice to make sure to demonstrate you tried your best and that you’re not wasting their precious time. Throughout the boot camp, it came to be a running joke that everyone would have an emotional breakdown at least once during their time at Codeup. You would see someone walk off and come back with teary, red eyes. Or for some, they would vocalize their despair: “I don’t think I’m cut out for this.”, “This is too hard.”, “I’m so frustrated!”, “Maybe I should just give up.” I myself broke down emotionally several times during Codeup and reiterated several mental self-doubts to myself: “Maybe I should have stuck to the arts. I’m too emotional to do well in computer science. I’ll never be good enough”. On some days, you would feel accomplished and confident in your abilities. On other days, the doubts would flood in unexpectedly and endanger everything I had worked so hard for. However, through the support of other students in the class, the instructors, and the encouragement of the staff, I was able to succeed throughout the course and completed my Demo Day project. All this is to say, Codeup taught me to have emotional fortitude and a confidence to believe in myself. Because to be honest, the first several months at my job also felt like an emotional roller coaster. I was thrown into an environment where I had to learn and adapt very quickly.  I was constantly afraid and timid because I was the only female developer and also the most junior developer. I expected a lot out of myself, and when I was given criticism I would internally berate myself until my negative self-talk had multiplied the original piece of criticism in my mind ten-fold of what it actually was.However, my experience at Codeup had taught me to push through in those moments of self-doubt. It gave me a thicker skin in order to ask for help, to learn quickly amidst a ton of ambiguity, and most importantly, a realization that it will always get better as long as I don’t give upAs you might have noticed, none of the points above are actually related to the technical knowledge I received by attending Codeup and how it affected my career. It goes without saying that Codeup provided me with the coding skills I needed to be succeed in my career. However, another point that our instructors emphasized was that Codeup was not a comprehensive coding academy or computer science degree. In some ways, it was like a tour bus that allowed you a brief overview of all the major stops in the area. It allowed us to have the impetus and catalytic energy to start off a software development career. It also gave us the tools to quickly be able to pick up any technologies our companies were using. “We’re teaching you how to learn,” they would say throughout the course. After starting my first job, I came to realize how true this statement was. I imagined myself trying to pick up the technologies at my job without having Codeup as a primer and it seemed near impossible.Needless to say, Codeup was an essential experience I needed on the way to becoming a full-time software developer. I learned critical skills that have proved invaluable in my day-to-day and have allowed me to be where I am today.— Joyce is a full time software developer at Armor, a cloud security company in Richardson, TX.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-paid-43-for-my-codeup-tuition/,How I Paid $43 For My Codeup Tuition - Codeup,"Nov 27, 2019 | Alumni StoriesBootcamps or career accelerator programs are short term education programs designed to help you learn new skills and find a job. If you are thinking about attending one, I will share some tips about finding a bootcamp, my story about how I chose to attend Codeup in San Antonio, TX and how I got funding to attend.My first tip is to spend at least a few months to a year researching the topic you want to study and the bootcamps available. There are tons of resources online to learn programming. I will provide a detailed table below of the courses I took, most of which are free. While you are learning the basics, start to learn about the bootcamps that teach this subject, read through bootcamp curriculum, take notes on tuition costs and start dates and note whether or not they provide scholarships. This first step is crucial for figuring out if this topic is something you are genuinely interested in.Secondly, when you start researching bootcamps, you will find that cost of tuition can be high. The best strategy is to look simultaneously look for funding and bootcamps. First look locally and seek out local and federal grants to attend based on being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field (minorities). I was only able to find funding because I met with a local career training program which enabled me to access local and Department of Labor funds. If you don’t meet the criteria of being being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field, then don’t worry! There are still other scholarships and loans out there.Warning!—only start to contact/call up the bootcamps when you are comfortable with your basic skills in programming (or whatever you are trying to learn) and when you are committed to attending. Bootcamp admissions will aggressively seek you out. They want you to attend their courses. You should have clear intentions about what you want to do, how much money you want to spend, and how good you are at programming. Just be honest with the people you speak to about your circumstances. This is a process so take your time. Often, if you get rejected from a bootcamp, you can still re-apply later.Lastly, there are almost always loan companies that specialize in loan for students of bootcamps. If the cost of tuition is still prohibitive, you can consider loans as your last option. In most cases, these loans can be repaid easily with the job you will (hopefully, most likely) get after you graduate. Some bootcamps offer refunds if you don’t get a job (with conditions) and others offer deferred tuition where you don’t pay anything until you get your first job.As for my experience, I learned about Data Science online and spent 10 months researching the subject and bootcamps. I took a slew of courses online to learn the basics, which I will share below. Then I started to apply to bootcamps. Ultimately, I was able to find Codeup in my hometown. I visited their campus and spoke with their admissions representative about funding. I loved that this school was in my hometown, so it was a practical choice for a full-time program. I also liked the instructors and admissions people that I met. The admissions person told me about their funding options and sent me to a local career training program, which informed me about local and federal grants that were not easily accessible online. Working with this local program was long and uncertain but I stuck with it. The real reasons I was able to get funding through them were because I had been under-employed for years, I had used up all my savings, I was living at home with family and I was unemployed at the time that I applied for the funding. In the end, I chose Codeup because I was able to find funding, it was in my hometown and I genuinely liked the people I met there, especially Maggie Giust, the Senior Data Scientist.I will share a table of the exact funding amounts that I got below. This will probably not be the norm. I got extremely lucky with my funding.All in all, this whole process is precarious, scary and hard. You should give yourself plenty of time to research and learn about the process, the bootcamps and the subject you are trying to study.If you need any advice, please feel free to contact me directly.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/setting-myself-up-for-success-at-codeup/,Setting Myself Up For Success at Codeup - Codeup,"Feb 26, 2020 | Alumni StoriesLast year, I knew I needed to make a career change, but I had no idea where to begin. I had fallen into the trap of working mindless jobs only to make ends meet. I was hungry for success and ready to transition from a “job” to a “career,” but I did not know what would get me there. After conducting a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the tech industry is where I wanted to get started, specifically as a web developer. Unfortunately, when I did a Google search for “coding bootcamp,” I came across about 6,000,000 results. Some programs offered courses online, in-person, or a combination of the two. As for the financial options, programs either offered financial assistance or none at all. I was having a difficult time choosing the best program for me because I was left with so many questions. To find answers to my questions, I decided to schedule calls with the programs I was interested in. After talking to several bootcamps, I was able to narrow down my options. I needed a program located in San Antonio, TX that offered in-person learning and tuition assistance. This was when I knew Codeup was the best possible option for me. I wanted an in-person experience because I needed an environment that would help me find the success I was after. As I did my research on Codeup, it became clear that they were going to provide the best experience for me.Now that I graduated and am looking back, I know I made the right decision. While I could mention all of the many ways that Codeup changed my life, I want to share some of the benefits for any individuals considering going here. Every day, I was taught by experienced instructors from all types of backgrounds and with various teaching styles. I had an amazing cohort that shared the journey with me and I can confidently say that I have made lifelong friends. I was also surrounded by an amazing network of alumni, staff, employer partners, and the tech community in San Antonio. Everything about Codeup is so much more effective because it is in-person. One of my favorite experiences at Codeup was the career simulation and preparation. I was able to work one-on-one with a professional that is going to help place me in my first web developer position. I feel like none of this success would have been possible if I decided to take an alternate route through an online program or part-time environment.Editor’s Update: While COVID-19 remains prevalent, classes will be conducted online as a necessity. However, the live online classroom simulates an in-person environment with video lecture and lab, breakout rooms, office hours, reviews, exams, and more, right alongside your cohort! The career simulation and preparation hasn’t ended, in fact, it’s even more developed! Learn more about Codeup Remote, here.Going to school full-time was not an easy task, but here is how I made it possible:  If you are considering Codeup’s web development program, my advice is that you ask yourself if you are ready to commit to changing your career and ultimately your life in five months. A full-time program is not easy, but the outcome is going to be worth it if you put in hard work. Remember that you are not sacrificing your time, but are instead investing in a better version of you.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Beverly Jaimes-Puente is a Web Developer in the San Antonio area.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/breaking-the-mold-my-journey-to-become-a-software-developer/,Breaking the Mold: My Journey To Become A Software Developer - Codeup,"Jan 22, 2020 | Alumni StoriesBy Ryan Smith, Codeup AlumnusWhenever I tell someone that I’m a software developer, I generally get the surprised “You? You’re a software developer?”.I, like many others that have graduated from Codeup, don’t fit the mold most people think of when they think of people in tech.To be honest, I can barely believe that I am one as well. Throughout 12 years in school, I was a straight C or D student when it came to math or science and wasn’t super excited about college. When I graduated, instead of going to college, I became a missionary in Colombia for two years. Colombia was an intense, immersive experience and I figured that when I got back to the States I would try out college. The results? I lasted a semester in college and did horrible in my science class. My first week in college and I called a Marine Corps recruiter to let him know that I would be joining as soon as possible. College just wasn’t for me. A week after my first semester and I was in boot camp. I spent the next 5 years in The Marine Corps mostly as a military working dog handler, trainer and instructor. It was honestly the best job I ever had.Unfortunately, the military had other plans for me that didn’t involve working with dogs, so I got out and worked as a private security dog handler at the Baghdad embassy for a short time. I figured this was the next logical step. I came to find out that the job sounded good on paper, but sitting at a guard shack for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, left me feeling unfulfilled and wanting more out of my life. A week before going back to Baghdad for the last time, I was toying with the idea of coding and came across Codeup. I was accepted into the program a couple of days later and left for Baghdad and started once I returned. Compared to all my life experiences, Codeup was mentally one of the hardest things I’ve accomplished. But if I can do it, so can you. What would have taken me years and years to accomplish, took me about 5 months. Less than two weeks after I graduated Codeup I was offered a job as a software developer at a well-known company where I’ll start in about a week.The decision to go to Codeup, give it my all and come out the other side a software developer- will affect my life in every way and also that of my future family. I’m grateful for all the staff and instructors there and thankful that I don’t just have a graduation certificate, but the actual skills I need to succeed for the rest of my life.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-bootcamp-to-bootcamp-how-i-found-purpose-through-coding/,From Bootcamp to Bootcamp; How I found purpose through coding - Codeup,"May 30, 2019 | Alumni StoriesWhen I was 17 years old an Army recruiter came along and convinced me that the military was a good choice and could afford me many great opportunities in life. At the time I was living a carefree life with a close friend. I hadn’t considered what the next year of my life would look like, let alone the next decade. I didn’t really see myself as a soldier, but I was strongly encouraged to enlist and so I did. It was during this time that I began playing around with building websites. I was far from good at it, but I enjoyed it, a lot.In April of 2018 I found out about coding bootcamps. I had never considered that I could make a living as a web developer. I didn’t even know what a web developer did. But it turns out that developers do the things that I enjoyed so much that I stayed up all night doing them. At the time I was managing a small cafe, making $11 an hour. I was also a part-time uber driver to help make ends meet. It sucked, big time. It was at this time that I made the best decision I’ve ever made. I quit that job and decided to focus on teaching myself how to code while I researched coding bootcamps that would allow me to use the remaining months I had left of my GI-Bill. It was important to me that the school be reputable, care about their students and have a solid track record of getting students a job. Codeup met all those requirements.Before attending Codeup, I decided that if I was going to risk the time and money it would require to improve my life and take a chance on something I knew I truly enjoyed I’d have to do some things differently. I was going to have to give it 110% because if I failed at this I didn’t want there to be any possibility that it was because I held anything back.I like to think that my military training kicked into overdrive.While at bootcamp, I arrived hours early, sometimes turning on the lights myself. Many evenings I stayed late to study and work on projects. I took pride in everything I did, making each and every project better than the last and paying attention to the details. I stayed positive, took care of myself and made coding my life. I hardly watched any television at all, one of my favorite pastimes. I also developed some amazing friendships. I continuously modified my time and intentions at Codeup to shape the best outcome possible.Needless to say, this time around I was ready for it and bootcamp was one of the best experiences of my life.  Currently I work for Cognizant. It’s the best job I’ve ever had. It feels just like Codeup where I was constantly learning and loving every second of it. I work with all the friends I made at Codeup and the salary is… well, like everything else, a dream come true.There’s absolutely nothing I would change about my experiences -Army bootcamp or coding bootcamp. I know without a doubt that because I attended both, I’m living my best life!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/why-im-thankful-for-codeup/,Why I'm Thankful for Codeup - Codeup,"Nov 21, 2018 | Alumni StoriesBy Amy Yanaway Almost every day since graduating from Codeup in December 2017, I have meditated over how much my life has changed in such a short period of time. Especially during this Thanksgiving season, I took the time to reflect even more deeply about the top three reasons I am grateful for Codeup. I am thankful for: When they say that Codeup is a “career accelerator,” they are not joking! In just 18 weeks, you graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the industry as a junior developer. When I was first searching for options to learn how to code, I was told that any college degree program would take me two to four full-time years, or four or more part-time years, to finish. As we all know, our bills do not get put on hold while we are in school! I also looked into free or inexpensive part-time programs so that I could continue to work full-time, and although I would describe myself as diligent and able to handle self-study, this would also have been a long route, and without the career advice and connections Codeup provides. Knowing what I know now, I am so glad I didn’t try to study on my own. The depth of Codeup’s curriculum, compared to some online training I have tried, is unmatched and very important to have in my current work as a developer.When you think about it, 18 weeks is a blip in your life, especially when that blip of time in Codeup very quickly produces a return on your investment. Remember to consider wages lost when making your decision: your time is VALUABLE, and time spent not in the workforce is wages lost that you could have been making. Speaking of finances, I am also thankful for…Did you know that many students receive internal scholarships and financial help from Codeup’s funding partners? I, too, had sticker shock when I saw the price tag, but I ended up receiving Codeup’s Women in Tech scholarship, as well as a grant from Project Quest, which greatly reduced my cost. For the remaining balance, I utilized one of Codeup’s loan partners, which offers reduced payments while in school, and for two months after. Read more about my journey through Codeup here. Last but not least, I am thankful for…Until just a few years ago, I had never in my life met a computer programmer. I was not aware that this was a thriving career, or that development and IT jobs occupy many of the slots on Glassdoor’s list of top careers. For several years, I was stuck in another field that was not for me, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how to get my foot in the door of this industry that seemed like it would better suit me and my needs. However, I did not have any connections in the industry or the direction needed to do this myself.Codeup provided access to the tech field to me, as a woman who knew nothing about code prior to attending, and as someone who constantly doubted (and still do sometimes) whether I would be able to grasp what I had heard was very difficult subject matter. They saw potential in my aptitude and, more importantly, in my attitude. Life since Codeup has been incredible. My job is fun, challenging, and stimulating; most of the time, it feels like I’m working on jigsaw puzzles all day. The hours just fly by, and I can’t believe I’m getting paid for this! Sometimes, when that pesky ol’ imposter syndrome pops up, a coworker of mine will brag about the quality or speed of my work to my supervisor, and I’ll feel validated and appreciated all over again, despite my newness to the field. Financially, I also feel appreciated, as I am now a skilled worker in high demand. In fact, in less than a year since graduating from Codeup, I was able to purchase my first home, all by myself!This truly has been a life changing year. Codeup got me in the door of the tech industry, and where I go from here is up to me.

I didn’t have any major goals or expected to make any life-changing decisions, then I lost my best friend, my mentor in life.Tito Bradshaw lived life to the fullest and was a leader in the cycling community. This death kickstarted me onto a path to change my life and do more than I ever thought I was capable of. Like Tito, I decided to go on an adventure and explore New York, push my body past its limits in strength and endurance and somehow I ended up in the right place at the right time and met some people from Codeup.I always thought I would just be in sales my entire life and have an uneventful life, this year I have done more than I could have ever imagined. Conversations went from “Look how much I sold!” to “Look what I programmed!!!”.I am so humbled to end this year not as “Eddy the Sales guy” but as a Software Developer! I’m excited to land my first dev role, explore new city’s and most importantly give back to my community. I know if Tito was here he would be proud.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Eddy Bautista is a Full Stack Web Development Alumni, follow him on Linkedin to hear more about his journey! Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-the-service-industry-to-software-development/,From the Service Industry to Software Development - Codeup,"Oct 8, 2018 | Alumni StoriesBy Randi MaysFor many teenagers, the path to self-reliance starts in one of two places: a restaurant or retail store. Until it’s time to begin a professional career, you’re working that part-time job stocking shelves, helping irate customers with expired coupons or prepping for the dinner rush. I’d venture to say I’m one of the very few who was sad to leave that lifestyle behind.I worked in the food service and retail industries for 10 years before I attended Codeup. I took great pride in my work every day; I couldn’t go home until everything was near perfect: my work area spotless, the shelves neatly stocked and everything ready for the next shift. When it came time to leave the service industry and move on to professional work, I was initially reluctant. I had found great personal fulfillment and success in customer service. Why would I want to leave? I have big dreams. Of course I want to travel the world, spending my vacations in exotic destinations, trying new foods, seeing centuries-old architecture, and making lasting memories. But more importantly, I wanted to work for a company with a more widespread mission than gastronomic satisfaction. I wanted to work alongside people with a passion for their work that ran far deeper than a paycheck.After graduating from Codeup in September 2016, I began working for USAA as a software developer and I can tell you–the company is no stranger to giving. Each employee receives company paid volunteer hours and I used some of mine to volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank among dozens of other USAA employees. Last year when Hurricane Harvey hit, USAA was quick to organize several volunteer sessions at their home campus to prepare food and other basic necessities to be delivered to people in need. They even have a system where I can automatically deduct a specified amount from my paycheck to give to charitable causes I am passionate about. I have heard story after story about their representatives on the phone going above and beyond their duties to serve members in combat zones and at home. I can’t enumerate here all of the reasons I admire USAA for its community involvement and caring, but I’m sure I’ve made my point.There are times I look back on my experience in food service and retail nostalgically, remembering how I excelled in those positions and enjoyed the repetitive work. Then I come back to the present and remember how big an impact my employer makes serving the military community and their families, and how many lives are changed by the work I do with my team. I find great personal satisfaction and pride in my work every day, and I am just getting started.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/what-to-expect-at-codeup/,"Life at Codeup: Setting Expectations for Before, During, and After | Codeup","Oct 1, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsSetting Expectations for Life Before, During, and After CodeupHave you been wondering about whether or not you can keep your current job during Codeup, or if Codeup classes will let you work around certain hours of certain days, or if you really have to apply so far in advance? We get questions like this all the time from prospective students. To make sure you’re successful in your career transition, let’s first set up some expectations about what you can expect before, during, and after Codeup. What is it like to experience life at a coding bootcamp?  The number one, most important, most helpful advice we can give is: do the prework! Give yourself a month to carefully understand and complete the prework we assign when you’re accepted, which was made to help you practice active learning and problem-solving. You’ll soon find that programming is all about practice and getting that muscle memory, like learning to play an instrument. You will thank yourself if you finish it, and risk falling behind if you don’t.In order to complete the prework, you’ll need to apply early. Why? Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You’ll need to be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework. The multi-step application process can take several weeks to over a month. Combining the prework timeframe plus the application timeframe means you should apply seven weeks before your start date. This will also give you enough time to secure grant funding, if applicable, as that also takes about a month to be processed. You can learn more about our application process here.  Codeup classes are full-time, immersive experiences. As a Codeup student, these are the times you will need to be in class: Classes are being conducted daily via live Zoom calls with instructors and other classmates. Optional office hours are held before and after class for additional help. You should plan to spend 20-25 additional hours per week practicing what you learned in class. You should also arrive at your workstation with coffee in tow 30 minutes before class starts so that you can map out your schedule for the day, and review what questions you have going into lecture. Combining office hours, planning, and practicing, you can expect to be occupied from 8am to 7 or 8pm almost daily. Now that you know your new schedule, you can probably see that you won’t have time for much else. Just for a few months, you’ll have to do the bare minimum outside of Codeup. You will need to quit your job. Before joining Codeup, try to save enough money to pay your bills for 6 months. We strongly suggest you avoid working outside of class, as this typically results in poor classroom performance, and we really want you to do well. If you have to work, calculate the bare minimum you need to earn each week in order to get by. Then, spread out your workload to do a little bit here and there throughout the week rather than full days on the weekends, because you do need rest days! The best options are flexible jobs where you’re in charge of your own schedule, such as food delivery, rideshare, dog walking, babysitting, etc. This is not the time to take an overnight shift at your current job or start your own business.You may need to downgrade your living situation to save up. Some students have sold their houses to make this investment possible. Some have moved in with in-laws to save on bills. Some have had to find roommates. Do whatever you can, within reason, to not have to work during Codeup!You won’t be able to adopt puppies, but you can get a fish, try raising plants, or look at pictures of puppies until you can get the real thing after you graduate! The last option is great because you’ll have a reward to work towards, but you have to earn it!Outside classes are also a no-go, but you can watch YouTube videos and documentaries on a new subject you’re interested in. Family and friends may not get to see you as much, but every weekend you can tell them all about what you’re learning and appreciate the time together that much more!Remember, it’s only 6 months of complete dedication to changing your life at a coding bootamp, and then you’ll be thanking yourself for the sacrifices you made!Gone are the days of copying lecture notes word-for-word. (Did that ever work, anyway?) Since you’ll have an online curriculum to read through and refer back to, write notes on what you don’t understand during reading, practice, or lecture. It’s good to track what exactly doesn’t make sense and what you’ve tried that didn’t work so you can ask more targeted questions, whether to peers, Google, or instructors. This way, you’re building yourself a roadmap to follow when you return to your studies each day.Learning how to code is like learning an instrument. Practice, practice, practice. You can do all the reading you want, watch all the video tutorials, and still not know how to code if you don’t actually code. There’s no cramming for exams, no writing research papers. It’s continuous learning and adding to your arsenal through a few additional hours of study/practice every day.In order to make the most of your experience, build on skills, and help yourself for the job search in the long run, you’ll be encouraged to attend meetups, join community Slack channels, and try to meet others in the industry to build your support network, so you have plenty of people to ask for help. You don’t have to go through this alone!  While this sounds totally foreign right now, it will become a daily mantra! Every Codeup student will make an account on a website called GitHub. On a daily basis, we’ll expect you to “commit” code, which means to make a revision to a code file, and then “push” that revision, which, in this case, means to transfer it from your computer to GitHub so that others can keep track of how often you’re coding. This is important to keep up after graduating Codeup to keep your coding skills fresh, and so that potential employers can see that you’re actively working on your craft.Every day between graduation and the start of your job, you should become more valuable and skilled, not less polished and more rusty. The learning never stops, especially not in tech, and especially not in data science! What’s all the rage one year may be out of date the next, and it’s your responsibility to stay on top of the latest technology, programming languages, and practices.We have a whole team dedicated to helping students get jobs! Our placement team will assist you even after graduating. You’ll spend time every day on either finding new listings, touching up your resume and LinkedIn, applying, or interviewing…and that’s in addition to coding every day. You gotta put in the work to find work. Do be prepared to get rejected sometimes, but trust the process. It’s much better to face these mass unemployment rates with a whole team working to get you hired rather than on your own.In summary, you get out what you put in. Our most successful students finished their pre work and made significant life sacrifices to stay focused and committed to the program. Others that weren’t ready, willing, or able to make the changes they needed were unfortunately not able to finish. However, those that do continue to reap the rewards!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/fastest-growing-private-companies/,Codeup on Inc. 5000 Fastest Growing Private Companies in America!,"Aug 13, 2020 | Codeup NewsWe’re excited to announce a huge Codeup achievement! Inc. magazine has placed Codeup at No. 3309 on its annual Inc. 5000 list, the most prestigious ranking of the nation’s fastest-growing private companies. The list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the American economy’s most dynamic segment— independent small businesses. Intuit, Zappos, Under Armour, Microsoft, Patagonia, and many other well-known names gained their first national exposure as honorees on the Inc. 5000.  Not only have the companies on the 2020 Inc. 5000 been very competitive within their markets, but the list as a whole shows staggering growth compared with prior lists as well. The 2020 Inc. 5000 achieved an incredible three-year average growth of over 500 percent and a median rate of 165 percent. The Inc. 5000’s aggregate revenue was $209 billion in 2019, accounting for over 1 million jobs over the past three years.  Complete results of the Inc. 5000, including company profiles and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at www.inc.com/inc5000. The top 500 companies are also being featured in the September 2020 issue of Inc.“The companies on this year’s Inc. 5000 come from nearly every realm of business,” says Inc. editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk. “From health and software to media and hospitality, the 2020 list proves that no matter the sector, incredible growth is based on the foundations of tenacity and opportunism.”  The 2020 Inc. 5000 is ranked according to percentage revenue growth when comparing 2016 and 2019. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2016. They had to be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2019. (Since then, a number of companies on the list have gone public or been acquired.) As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. Companies on the Inc. 500 are featured in Inc.’s September issue. They represent the top tier of the Inc. 5000, which can be found at http://www.inc.com/inc5000. The world’s most trusted business-media brand, Inc. offers entrepreneurs the knowledge, tools, connections, and community to build great companies. Its award-winning multiplatform content reaches more than 50 million people each month across a variety of channels including websites, newsletters, social media, podcasts, and print.

The global recognition that comes with inclusion in the 5000 gives the founders of the best businesses an opportunity to engage with an exclusive community of their peers, and the credibility that helps them drive sales and recruit talent.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/salary-refund-guarantee/,Introducing Our Salary Refund Guarantee - Codeup,"Nov 10, 2020 | Codeup News, EmployersHere at Codeup, we believe it’s time to revolutionize hiring. We’re launching a first of its kind Salary Refund Guarantee so that employers can hire our developers with no risk and full confidence. Codeup offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee to our students: get a job offer in-field within 6 months of graduating or we’ll refund your tuition. We’re proud of how that promise prioritizes student outcomes and holds us accountable to our core value to Deliver Excellence. But students are just one side of a two sided partnership. The ultimate customers are our employer partners that hire our grads. We love our partners – companies like USAA, Accenture, Booz Allen Hamilton, SWBC, and Social Solutions to name a few. And while we’ve always stood by our commitment to provide them with top talent, we never codified it in the same way as our tuition refund guarantee. That’s why we’re excited to announce our newly minted Salary Refund Guarantee: if you hire a Codeup grad and let them go within their first two weeks, we’ll reimburse 100% of their payroll. THAT is a no-risk hire. We believe in our students and our process, and we’re ready to put our money where our mouth is.  Let us de-risk the hiring process for you with a one-of-a-kind hiring Lemon Law. We have no recruitment fees, no placement fees, and we guarantee our grads with two weeks of insured pay. With a diverse pool of over 700 alumni composed of 30% military veterans, 25% women, and 50% minorities, we can curate a list of candidates that will meet your needs. Want to revolutionize your hiring process?

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/how-codeup-paid-off-for-both-employee-and-employer/,How Codeup Paid Off for Both Employee and Employer - Codeup,"Feb 10, 2021 | Codeup News, EmployersAfter graduating from Codeup in 2016, Stan H. was hired on by a digital media company called Lifeblue in Plano, TX. He made the move from San Antonio to Plano and has been working there ever since. With our recent expansion to Dallas and a successful 4-year employment, we were curious: Was attending and hiring from Codeup worth it? We interviewed him and his boss so you can learn how Codeup paid off for both employee and employer!Stan: I was living in San Antonio at the time and looking for a way to refresh my skills and become more marketable in the IT sector after working overseas for a long time. Codeup was the most attractive option and was right in the city.  Stan: Be honest with yourself about your skill set and don’t be afraid to ask questions to senior devs at the company. Even if those questions perhaps seem like things you think you should know or you think they expect you to know. Don’t let imposter syndrome get the best of you. If the company knows you came from a coding bootcamp, they should know that you are not the finished product and will require mentoring. Having said that, it is up to you to make sure you get that mentoring and ensure you keep on improving and building on top of what you learned at Codeup.   Stan: I think one of the biggest advantages that a Codeup grad has is having Codeup in their corner. All of Codeup’s resources, like contacts of potential employers, and the knowledge of what the industry is looking for and overall demands that need to be met, make getting your foot in the door much easier. You get added resume prep. You’re usually also better prepared. Collaboration experience of working on a project is another advantage a Codeup grad might have over another candidate.   Stan: Many Codeup grads have some sort of prior work and more life experience.  Stan: Getting to work on a diverse and ever challenging set of projects and do it all with a truly fantastic group of people.  Stan: The best part of Codeup was that it provided me with exactly what I hoped for and what Codeup said it could provide: the opportunity and means to attain a career as a web developer. Looks like the Codeup investment paid off! Employers investing in new developers find that the character and drive that got our alumni through Codeup is also what they like to see on the job! Four years later, it’s still paying off. For the employee, the Codeup investment has the power to not only change your career, but the trajectory of your whole life. Our partner network can get you to new towns you never would have considered, and bring you personal and professional growth opportunities you never would have thought possible. To learn more about hiring from Codeup, click here.learn more about attending Codeup, click here.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/annie-easley-scholarship/,The Annie Easley Scholarship: Supporting Blacks in Tech | Codeup,"Nov 9, 2020 | Codeup NewsWe have an exciting announcement! We’re launching a new scholarship to build and support the Black community in tech. The Annie Easley scholarship is a $1000 scholarship awarded to every Codeup student who identifies as Black or African-American. Read on to learn about our commitment to diversifying tech, our support of the Black community, and Annie Easley! We make an active, ongoing effort to cultivate inclusive growth at Codeup and in the tech field at large. By encouraging diversity in our cohorts, we are contributing to the long-term growth of underrepresented groups in tech when our students join the workforce. We offer need-based Pride, Veteran, Minorities in Tech, and Women in Tech scholarships. While the numbers of female, non-Black minority, and LGBTQIA+ developers are growing, they are still outpacing their Black counterparts. To help support the growth of the Black community in tech, our Annie Easley scholarship is a guaranteed $1,000 to every student who applies for the scholarship and identifies as Black and/or African-American.  In 2018, only 2.7% of professional developers identified as Black. In two years, that number grew by less than 1%. In 2020, only 3.6% of professional developers identify as Black, even though the overall population is 13.4% Black. For some context, 70.7% of developers identify as white.Why do we care? The people building technology should represent the people using technology, and we need to do more to make that happen. Empowering underrepresented developers can increase career opportunities, normalize this career path for rising professionals, and yield more inclusive and equitable technology solutions.  The centuries of racism and the ensuing, long-lasting burdens on the African-American population cannot be undone.  We acknowledge that there are built-in hurdles that Black Americans have to overcome that are based on thoughts and ideals resulting from that racism. What we can do is work to level the playing field by softening the financial barrier to entry into tech. Our hope is that a guaranteed scholarship will help facilitate this and open up opportunities. Annie Easley was one of the first Black employees at NACA (now NASA), where she worked as a human-computer, computer engineer, and rocket scientist from 1955-1989. She wrote the code for the computer program that controls the fuel mixture of the Centaur rocket, which went on to successfully launch several space probes and is still being used today. Additionally, her work on energy conversion systems and alternative energy technology was used to develop the batteries used in modern hybrid vehicles. Easley has also co-authored several papers on nuclear power plants and rocket science.In 1977, she went back to school to get a degree in Mathematics while working full-time, where she raised awareness about NASA and inspired many women and minorities to pursue STEM careers. Later in her career, she helped supervisors address discrimination complaints as an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor, and fought for women’s rights. Modern spaceflight likely wouldn’t be possible without her, and much of what we know about space might still be unknown. Her work has been monumental not only for African-Americans, not only for women, not only for programmers, but for technology as we know it. That is why we’re naming this scholarship and our next Data Science cohort after her. The technology of tomorrow starts today. If you identify as Black or African-American and would like to help build future technology, start a career as a software developer or data scientist!

Employers scoped out their top picks, conducted lightning round interviews, and set up next steps with candidates. Since going remote, however, we’ve seen a lot of companies struggle to mirror that type of engagement with the monotony of Zoom calls and resume reviews. So, we changed the game to make screening candidates easier and more fun with Developer Launch!Developer Launch mirrors an album drop, where you get teasers of what’s to come, sign up for early access, and then hit play.

Just hit “play” and you’ll see:Why did we make this drastic change? We listened to you, hiring managers, who told us:What does this mean for you as a hiring manager?

While of course 2020 had its downs, we’d like to reflect on the silver linings and victories we had. It was actually a very big year for Codeup, as you’ll see in this Codeup 2020 Year in Review!With virtual learning, we were able to deliver our mission to people all across Texas, not just at our physical campuses. Our staff grew exponentially. We launched two campuses and a new scholarship for Black and African-American students. We were named on Inc. 5000’s fastest-growing companies. We now offer total confidence for employers that hire our grads with a Salary Refund Guarantee. We’ve been growing our employer network all across the country due to remote opportunities. We launched an online store to raise funds for scholarships. Thanks to virtual graduation days, we now have video evidence of what students can accomplish by the end of Codeup. We’ve continued to show our immense support of new students and graduates with curbside swag pickups on Welcome Days, and celebratory pinata kits on graduation days. Best of all, we empowered life change for 161 individuals.It has been a year of growth for staff, students, and our community. This is our first time living through a global pandemic, which brought quite a lot more firsts.Looking at the Codeup 2020 Year in Review, we feel incredibly grateful that we were able to achieve so much this year. It all goes toward our mission of empowering life change, which we are now able to do on a much grander scale. If 2020 wasn’t your year, make 2021 the year you land your dream job.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/hiring-diverse-talent-with-codeup/,Hiring Diverse Talent with Codeup - Codeup,"Mar 9, 2021 | Codeup News, EmployersHiring qualified software developers is hard. Hiring a team of qualified developers that don’t all have the same resume and demographics is even harder. For hiring managers looking to grow their teams with diverse talent, we can help.Diversity in employment isn’t only a simplistic comparison of race and gender. Those are, of course, critical demographics to focus on when leveling the playing field, but they are only two. People often forget about other variables like age, educational background, military service, physical ability, and work history. Hiring diverse talent means more than splitting your team 50/50 and calling it a day; it means introducing and empowering as many divergent identities, experiences, and perspectives as possible.Take a minute to reflect on your own team. How many non-male individuals are there? How many non-white and non-male individuals work on your team? Do you work alongside any military veterans? Have you interviewed any LGBTQIA, alternative education, or disabled individuals? When you expand your definition and begin to think about the intersectionality of identity, building a diverse team gets a lot more complicated than hiring out of a CS program.We don’t have the perfect solution – nobody does. But one of Codeup’s core values is to Cultivate Inclusive Growth, and we are committed to learning every day how we can empower life change for diverse populations. We’ve seen that building diverse teams starts with building diverse candidate pipelines.    Whatever your barrier to hiring diverse talent, we can help. Reach out to us at partners@codeup.com.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/college-in-decline-and-bootcamps-on-the-rise-amid-covid-19/,College in Decline and Bootcamps on the Rise Amid COVID-19 - Codeup,"Jan 29, 2021 | Codeup NewsQuestioning college? You and apparently millions of others! The COVID-19 pandemic has seen college in decline and bootcamps on the rise as people flock to shorter-term options that offer a clear career path and a marketable skillset. For some, it’s the newfound financial strain causing them to realize they need a new career ASAP and can’t spend 4 years and $50k to get it. A recent Wall Street Journal article even wonders, “Is This the End of College as We Know It?” Keep reading for our interpretation. College is generally accepted as the thing to do after high school, but it wasn’t always that way. The “college for all” campaign originated during the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, when college was a luxury for the rich. It caused a racial and classist divide as those that couldn’t afford it took on trades. However, college is still a luxury for the rich. Only now, those that can’t afford it have to fight for scholarships and grants or bear the burden of student loan repayment for three, four, sometimes five or more decades. Thanks to student loan repayment, many feel forced to postpone life milestones, unable to finance a house or children while catching up on debt. In the midst of a pandemic, that financial strain is a risk people are more hesitant to take.What’s the point of college, anyhow? Why insist that everyone should go even if it causes financial strain for decades? Well, because it’s supposed to give us the education we need to be successful, prepare us for the working world, and get us to a job where we can make use of our degree right after college. For the lucky few, that actually happened. The rest didn’t get the Return on Investment they hoped for. After college, they struggled to find their way, often winding up in career paths that don’t require their degree, but all the while, continuing to pay for it. A promised not delivered? Not exactly, because there was never a legal promise, just advice from everyone around them. An unfortunate debt and learning experience? Some may call it that.So if not college, then what? Many are going against the grain, saving tens of thousands of dollars and years of their life in the process. Who’s profiting? Institutions that offer short-term training in a marketable skill, and their students. The pandemic has loomed upon us for about a year now, and in that year, short-term credential classes saw an enrollment spike of 8 million students, a 70% increase from just before COVID-19. Meanwhile, enrollment of freshmen in college dropped 16%. Going this route, even students are profiting, as they’re able to start earning income much faster.While short-term classes in more traditional trade careers, like electricians, mechanics, plumbing, and some health care professions have been around since 1879, coding bootcamps are really at the heart of this spike. They’re newer and more enticing to the emerging adults of Gen Z. They help millennials right the wrongs of their post-grad plans not working out. Even older generations are seeing the shift to a technical world and want in. Our aim here at Codeup is to develop the workforce, our mission to empower life change. While we can’t speak to any other coding schools’ mission, their aim is more or less the same. College provides a place to learn while coding bootcamps and trade schools provide a clear path into a career. College provides an often broad and philosophical education, covering a wide array of topics like history, science, and liberal arts, with a focus on whatever we are interested in. Coding bootcamps and trade schools prepare you for one thing and one thing only, with a focus on in-demand careers. It’s everything you need to know, and nothing you don’t.Currently in college and feeling stuck? Transition out with Codeup, where you can start your career 10X faster!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/oops-i-got-a-degree-in/,Oops I Got a Degree In... - Codeup,"Dec 14, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsIs your degree not getting you the job prospects you hoped for? Having doubts about college? Accidentally study Wizardry for four years? We have heard many stories about degrees that didn’t pan out long term. At our event “Oops I Got a Degree In…,” Codeup Data Science alumni Nicole Garza and Jesse Ruiz were living proof that your degree doesn’t have to box you in. Our Director of Marketing and Admissions, who studied Health and Exercise Science, led a discussion on how their seemingly non-relevant degrees got them to where they are now. Keep reading to see how Jesse went from Ivy League graduate to Codeup alumna, and how Nicole went from interning for the mayor to building up a data science department. Nicole: My name is Nicole and I have a degree in Political Science with a minor in Sociology.Jesse: I’m Jesse. I have an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, then studied Fine Arts in graduate school. Nicole: I interned for the mayor’s office, but you need a certain personality type to do politics. I’d rather be behind a screen.Jesse: I was an artist and taught art. It was a really fun and amazing opportunity but it wasn’t financially secure.  Nicole: I did some jobs where I had to work with data, descriptive statistics, and a database. Then I got interested in pursuing that at a higher level.Jesse: With my degree in Philosophy at an Ivy League, I got lots of training in analytical thinking and study habits. I did well in calculus and physics, and being an artist took a huge amount of self-discipline and creativity. I see all of those things largely in data science. Nicole: Both my brothers are developers, and software developers are a great resource to help understand the coding part of data science. Some courses in my undergrad had a heavy emphasis on research, data, and statistical analysis and I remembered that I enjoyed those.Jesse: I started searching for other career opportunities and took a lot of quizzes about what the best career is for your personality. I did a lot of research in the field and consulted my cousin who is a software developer. It took me about a year of part-time self-teaching for me to actually understand the field. Nicole: Take a short online class to see if it’s something you’d perhaps enjoy. Something very simple and basic. Talk to people in the field. Think about past courses or experiences that you enjoyed or were good at. Jesse: Take a predetermined period of time taking some courses and harnessing your network. Talk to your cousin that’s in the field, or the career services at your alma mater to think through your options with someone else. Nicole: The job I was at before Codeup wasn’t for me. It was very repetitive and I wanted something different, more creative, something that would get the wheels of my mind turning. I started researching options and wanted something that started at a beginner level. Then shortly after, Codeup announced their new data science program. I did some research on it, took the tests and the rest is history!Jesse: It takes a leap of faith. At the time, I was going through some health issues. I was worried about not having health insurance and living at home with my mom and barely making enough money. Codeup has done a great job of helping students work through even the really serious aspects of the decision-making process. I gave myself a year of researching and studying, and then I got funding. When I got funding there was no turning back, I was gonna do this. I think about if I would have done the program if I didn’t have funding, probably. The cost is scary. But if you spend enough time thinking about it, considering the field, and introspecting about where you want your personal life to go, I think that’s what it takes Nicole: When I first started at the company I’m at now, they were just using Excel to do everything and used zero coding. So, I came in and they really relied on me to help innovate and change things. I started changing a lot of the processes from Excel over to Python and R but I was afraid that I was not doing things correctly because I was new to the field. I was scared I was kind of leading the company in the wrong direction or something. But I double, triple checked everything I did and made sure it’s right. Now, we’ve been growing and the company has more than doubled in size!Jesse: Finding a job afterward is very stressful and uncertain. Once you start working, you kind of go back to lots of learning and adjusting. Sometimes in my new team that I’m on, I feel like there are moments I don’t really know what I’m doing. But it’s obvious to me that no one knows everything, and I can know things that more experienced or senior people might not know and that’s okay. So no, I haven’t experienced it that much. Nicole: I work at Guardian Premier Solutions. I think they found me through the Codeup Alumni Portal and contacted me. We interviewed for 30 minutes, and within one week they asked when I can start. We monitor psychological and physiological data through devices and tests to determine the best type of military training candidate. That’s something I’ve really been enjoying, and I really enjoy my coworkers as well. They really value input and new ideas, and I love that. Really grateful for this job, it’s been really great. Thanks, Codeup! Jesse: Initially out of Codeup, I worked with a small boutique consulting firm, I was a contractor developing Excel macros. I was there short term and then got a job at USAA, also as a contractor. I was working on a team that was doing some design work and making presentations. Then, I transferred to a team that did data reporting, then to a team that did machine learning. I became a full-time employee and now get benefits. Honestly, everything’s been great and I’ve achieved everything I wanted to out of Codeup, which includes moving out of my mom’s house! I’m living a more stable life now. Overall, it’s been really great.  Hopefully, these stories serve as inspiration to not put yourself in a box simply based on your degree! The tech field is welcoming to anyone that can learn the skills, no matter their educational background. If you’ve been wanting to pivot to a different field than what your degree is in, Codeup is the perfect place to start!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/do-coding-bootcamps-help-you-get-a-job/,Do Coding Bootcamps Help You Get a Job? - Codeup,"Mar 16, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWondering how or if coding bootcamps help you get a job? We can’t speak for the other guys, but at Codeup, our job isn’t done until you have yours. To see how many of our students actually get hired and what their salaries look like, click here. Rest assured that if you don’t get hired within 6 months of graduating, you will get your tuition back. How is this possible? Besides a top-notch curriculum and expert instruction, each student undergoes professional development and has a full team working to get them hired. Keep reading to learn how this coding bootcamp helps you get a job!Ever tried career coaching? Don’t knock it ‘til you try it! Launching a new career takes more than skill. You gotta have what it takes to get yourself seen and nail your interviews. Between our various professional development staff, each student will receive about 10 hours of individual coaching. Beyond that, you can set up as many 1 on 1 sessions with our Career Coaches as you want. You’ll have workshops and deliverables, both in the program and post-grad. We’ll personally review your resume and LinkedIn, and you’ll learn about the expectations of you as a professional and how to meet them. We’ll even help you nail your first impression with mock technical and behavioral interviews. Keep in mind, we don’t do it all for you! We give you the tools and coaching, but you will be the one applying for jobs and implementing what you’ve learned. This isn’t your optional career help desk or a one-and-done session. This is an ongoing, baked-in part of the curriculum! You’ll come out of Codeup as a true tech professional.The career guidance doesn’t end there! Imagine having a whole team of recruiters sending you applications, setting up interviews, proof-reading your cover letters, and coordinating your job search. Add to that the accountability it comes with. It’s like having a coach telling you what you need to do every day to get results, and how to learn from past mistakes. On top of that, you get to leverage our employer network of companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, Oracle, and Whole Foods. We are constantly forming new connections with employers to grow our network, thereby growing your network, as well as nurturing long-lasting partnerships. How else do coding bootcamps help you get a job? Through Codeup, hiring managers will see your face on our emails, social media, Youtube, your own dedicated page on our website, and a highlight of your final capstone project. Rather than sending a resume out into the ether and never knowing if anyone saw it, you can be certain that we’re showcasing you to every audience that we have. We even leverage our partners’ networks with similar marketing materials to help us reach new audiences. That is a lot of value!If you aren’t hired right after graduation, we will not leave you by the wayside. If it takes 6 months to find a job, that is how long your team of recruiters will work with you. When your skills are rusty and you’re just not getting those technical interviews, our Technical Career Coach will work with you even after graduation. If you don’t get a job within 6 months of graduating, you will get your money back. That peace of mind: priceless.Ready to take on your job search with us?

After 6 years of helping adults transition into tech careers in San Antonio, and 1 year of operating in Dallas, it’s time to launch our Houston bootcamp. What better place to expand to than Houston, the largest city in Texas, and one of the top five largest cities in the country? In Houston, the demand for tech talent is high, the population is vast and diverse, and Texas still has the 10th largest economy in the world. With a commitment to placing our graduates in real tech jobs, we go where the demand is and where our employer partnerships lead.  Launching a new campus during this pandemic won’t change much from the student perspective. Just like before, people from all across Texas can enroll in our programs, and classes will continue to be remote until it is safe to open our campuses. However, with a physical presence in Houston, we will be able to better expand our employer partnerships and build our network so our Houston bootcamp students can get the best experience possible! You can become a software developer after 22 weeks in our virtual Full-Stack Web Development program. Classes are conducted live via Zoom along with your classmates. Interested in building custom applications? Learn more about how to bring your ideas to life with Codeup here.While we won’t officially be launching our Houston bootcamp with a Data Science program, people all across Texas still have the rare opportunity to attend the Data Science program that’s based out of San Antonio, since that is also virtual.

https://codeup.com/data-science/why-you-should-become-a-data-scientist/,Why You Should Become a Data Scientist - Codeup,"Mar 11, 2021 | Data ScienceWhat do you look for in a career? Chances are, you’re looking for a way to make use of your particular talents, a field that’s secure and reliable, a work/life balance, and good compensation. For the right people, data science offers all of that and more! It was LinkedIn’s #1 Most Promising Job in 2019, and Glassdoor’s 2nd Best Job of 2021! Actually, Data Scientists topped that list from 2016 to 2019 before being dethroned by developers, which we also train at Codeup. So why all the hype? What makes it the best? Keep reading to learn why you should become a Data Scientist! Do your colleagues hate you for overanalyzing things? Have you found yourself turning everything into a spreadsheet? Do you make your life decisions based on careful calculations using past data? You might thrive as a data scientist! This is the first section on our list because data science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider where your strengths and interests actually lie. If you don’t have a penchant for numbers and historical patterns, or if careful analysis bores you, this may not be for you. For some people, though, data science is fascinating, rewarding, and a great way to make use of their talents and natural thought processes. Check out how much our students love what they do every week in this blog post.  The field is booming, the demand is high, and the job is the best. 2020 was the first year since 2016 that Data Scientist was not the number one job in America, according to Glassdoor. Now it sits at Number 2, but rest assured, the growth and demand show no signs of slowing down. Since 2012, there has been a 650% increase in data science positions. However, the supply of data scientists remains relatively low. Sure, it’s been the number 1 job for a while now and people are catching on, but more and more positions are also opening, so supply isn’t actually catching up to the demand. At least, for qualified data scientists.One reason for the continued low supply is that prospective data scientists who go traditional routes are often stuck in school for 2-4 years. Meanwhile, the demands and technologies are changing rapidly, so what they are learning risks being outdated by the time they graduate. Another reason is that a Master’s Degree does not in and of itself prepare grads with the skills needed for the job, or even just to nail their technical interviews. They might learn about data science for years, but if they don’t practice it, don’t have a repository that they push to regularly, haven’t built a data pipeline, don’t have project experience, etc., they aren’t ready to work as a data scientist. This lack of post-grad readiness is another contributor to the low supply, despite many graduate students thinking they’re ready for the job search. (Thinking of getting a Master’s Degree? Learn more, here.) Altogether, this makes a trained data scientist all the more valuable, relatively rare, and in very high demand.So, you know that demand is high now and that properly qualified data scientists (with flexible demands) will have no trouble finding a job. But you don’t just want a job now, you want a career for the long haul. Is this just a trend that’s going to fizzle out? Unlikely. Will this still be a secure path in the future, say 10 or 20 years down the road? All the data say yes!The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists Data Scientists as one of the fastest-growing occupations. They project a 31% growth rate with nearly 12 million new jobs between 2019 and 2029. More and more companies will have no choice but to start using data-driven decision making, lest they risk being put out of business by their data savvy competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of data science, alone is creating millions of jobs! However, it’s also wiping out over a million jobs. Want to make sure your skillset stays in-demand? Start a career with job security. Employers will always need humans to program the machines, understand the data pipeline, write the algorithms used by AI, and continue maintaining the tech and the data.Many of Codeup’s career transitioners know what it’s like to work in oilfields, call centers, food service, sales, retail, and teaching. The ones that don’t require manual labor or being on your feet all day still require odd hours, lots of emotional exertion, or giving up weekends. Some people love this sort of work, but others are missing that work/life balance. Work/life balance is something that’s completely subjective based on where you are in your life, how much you enjoy your work, how much is required of you, and so on.With a career in tech, you will very likely be working at a desk from 8 or 9am to 5 or 6pm with weekends off. You won’t be manual laboring, rushing to get someone to cover your shift, stressing about getting in hours, or speaking to customers or children all day long. Will some days be more stressful than others? Are you going to have to stay late sometimes to meet deadlines? Will you spend some of your “free” time learning the newest technologies? Yes. But for the most part, you can relax. You’ll have a steady work schedule, an average stress level, above-average flexibility should you need to adjust your schedule or take time off, and you will almost always have evenings and the weekends to yourself or to spend time with family and friends.Interested in boosting your earning potential? Data science is a lucrative field with a highly valuable skillset. You could potentially double your current salary with your very first in-field job. Your employer might also cover health insurance, provide retirement contributions, and offer flexible paid time off. Entry-level data scientists have some of the highest starting salaries around, with averages of:And it’s only upward from there as your career progresses. In San Antonio, which is where our headquarters are, we’re seeing salary averages of:Want to start earning six figures within a few years? Become a data scientist. With just a few years of experience, your talent becomes much more valuable. Keep reading to see how long it takes to advance.In the tech field, room for growth is limitless. There are always new technologies to learn and adapt to, new skills to perfect along the data pipeline, and career opportunities abound. The next step after beginning your career as a Junior Data Scientist is often Senior Data Scientist, which is the middle level. Typically, this requires 3-5 years of relevant work experience and the abilities to write reusable code, formulate machine learning algorithms, and build strong data pipelines in cloud environments. After senior is the top level, the most experienced member of the data science team. You may see them referred to with different titles, such as Vice President, Director, Head, or Chief. They lead the data science team, have over 5 years of experience, and are fluent or very well-versed along the data science pipeline. This person knows best practices for building and deploying a predictive model, can efficiently write code, and will know the highest impact projects to work on (TowardsDataScience). So, you’ve got a booming industry, a secure field, a skill set that’s in high demand, the ability to advance your career, a lucrative salary, a solid work/life balance, and to top it off, you get to do what you’re good at and passionate about. No wonder it’s the best job out there! If you enjoy working with data, this could be an incredibly fulfilling career path. Did you know it only takes 6 months to actually become a data scientist? Codeup will take you from “never heard of it” to your first job in-field. Interested?

Going remote hasn’t changed that! Two months into this remote world, we thought we’d pause today to explain how we prioritize your success and ensure you get hired. First of all, our career placement services are built on one-on-one relationships. Our Placement team works with students individually to develop a professional portfolio, define a strategy, and conduct a job search. They’ll help perfect your resume, conduct individual career coaching, and prepare you with mock interviews. And they don’t let off until you’ve signed that offer letter! Since we’ve gone remote, our placement team has digitized their curriculum so it’s accessible to all our students, and they’ve continued working one-on-one over Zoom.  Those one-on-one relationships aren’t exclusive to students. It’s the same approach our team takes with their network of hiring managers and recruiters. From curriculum advisory panels to guest speaker lunchtime talks, we involve employers as often as we can. We forge a personal relationship that encourages repeat hiring, open communication, and trust. Lastly, your job search kicks off with a bang in our staple Developer Days and Data Scientist Days. Normally, these are in-person demonstrations of capstone projects that end in a reverse job fair with employers. On April 16th, we hosted our first-ever virtual Developer Day. Over 160 people tuned into it live! Not only did we maintain the quality of the event, but we increased attendance and visibility. That event, especially while remote, kick starts your job search, connects you with employers, and increases your visibility as a candidate. In person or remote, we remain committed to empowering life change and helping our students land jobs in new career fields. If you’ve been affected by COVID-19 in any way (layoffs, health, family, etc), check out our recently announced COVID-19 Relief Scholarship.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/codeup-application-process/,Codeup's Application Process - Learn more on Codeup's Blog,"Sep 30, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsCurious about the application process? Wondering why you need to apply so far in advance? You’ve come to the right blog post! From pre-work to technical assessments, to financial aid and interviews, there are a number of reasons you need to apply 1-2 months ahead of your start date. To explain Codeup’s application process, let’s start by working backward. Note: The tilde (squiggly) means “approximately”. After being accepted, every incoming student is given a set of pre-work to do to familiarize themselves with some coding basics. You won’t be expected to have everything memorized, but some exposure will be required for you to hit the ground running on your first week of class. Many have likened our bootcamp to drinking out of a firehose- there’s a lot of ground to cover in 5 months! Completing the pre-work is the best gift you can give yourself in order to soften the blow. Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You should be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework.  Once you’re accepted, you’ll meet with our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager to discuss your financial aid options. She’s also Codeup’s School Certifying Official for VA Benefits, which take roughly 2 weeks to be processed. Scholarships are awarded about 2 weeks before the first class day, so you will need to have applied for any scholarships before then. Grants can range from 2-8 weeks to be processed and secured, but usually take about a month. You will need to be accepted before applying for grants. The tuition process is finalized in the month leading up to the start date, while you’re also working on prework. Think of this as a casual job interview. We want to make sure you are culturally and behaviorally cut out for Codeup. The intensity and rigor is not for everyone. In this step of the application process, we’re looking for motivated, positive, hard-working, and dedicated character traits. Bonus points if you read our blog post about tips for nailing a video interview!   For Web Development, we will give a couple of technical assessments to test your problem-solving skills. They are not necessarily pass/fail tests, but rather, they help us see how we can best prepare you for class. Those who do not do well on the first challenge have additional opportunities to develop their problem-solving skills. We want to be sure you are set up for success in class! For Data Science, the technical assessments may take much longer as there are more prerequisites, but it varies from person to person. We require a basic level of Python, math, and stats prior to being accepted. How well versed you are in those subjects determines how long this process takes. Could be a week if you were a math major in college, could be months if you’ve never heard of Applied Statistics. Plenty of our students knew nothing about stats or Python before applying but worked through our recommended resources (tutorials and workshops) in order to get to the level they need to be on. Don’t count yourself out! But do be realistic about how long it will take you to learn. If you were to apply for our Data Science program a couple weeks before class starts, knowing nothing about Python or stats, our Admissions Manager will be happy to provide all the necessary resources you need for a future start date, but you may not be qualified in time for the next class start, considering you’d also have to finish pre-work in that limited time. For both programs, we have weekly study sessions with our Teaching Assistants to help you with any material that’s causing you trouble! We may be virtual right now, but we’re still doing virtual campus visits! You can think of this as a program overview. We’ll discuss the admissions process, the curriculum, the schedule, how things are looking now that we’re remote, and any questions you might have. You can think of this as an initial admissions consultation or phone interview, but really we’re just making sure it’s the right fit! Some people think applying for Codeup means getting paid to learn to code, some people think we teach medical coding. This call is just to introduce ourselves, make sure you’re crystal clear on what Codeup is (a full-time career accelerator that trains and places data scientists and software developers), and to answer any questions you might have. The first step in your application process is your application! It’s basically just sending us your name and contact info so we can get the ball rolling on making you a Data Scientist or Software Developer! How exciting!Now, are you pumped to begin your own application process and experience all this in action? You can fill out your super quick application here. Our (helpful and friendly) Admissions team will be in touch ASAP to help you change careers. Even if you’re not sure if Codeup is right for you, we can help you work through your doubts and hesitancies in your initial phone call.  With an Admissions Manager as your guide, our Teaching Assistants as your personal tutors, and our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager as your tuition planning assistant, you’ll never have to go at this alone!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/a-second-career-start/,How To Have A Second Career Start With Codeup - Codeup,"Feb 7, 2020 | Tips for Prospective Students      A lot of students enter Codeup from a previous career. We encounter diverse professionals from teaching, military service, the service industry, music, and more. From those prospective students thinking about a change, we often hear concerns like: “I don’t have any technical skills or background,” “I’m just a teacher,” “I’m only a barista,” “I’m only a hobby computer person”…”I could never be a software developer.”       The good news is YOU, the people with a wide variety of non-software development backgrounds, are our specialty. At Codeup, you’ll leverage the qualities that make you good at what you already do, to excel in a new field.      If you’re thinking about switching careers, you’ve probably already followed a plan: you listened to advice from a guidance counselor, went to college, developed a skill set, landed a job, and grew in your role. But maybe you found the day-to-day wasn’t what you expected, that what you’re good at isn’t good for you, or even that you want to learn and grow more. Maybe you need a second start?      With over 574 alumni, we’ve heard that story a lot. We’ve also seen some surprising trends in common careers before entering Codeup. If you want a change but worry about the leap, check out some of the wide-ranging jobs Codeup grads come from and how their skills made them successful in the tech industry: Teacher/Educator Server/Barista Musician/Creative      One of the biggest misconceptions we hear from prospective students is that they are at a disadvantage coming from a non-technical background. In fact, your background, whatever it is, is an ADVANTAGE in learning a new skill and entering the tech workforce. There are plenty of CS graduates, but there are very few Marine-veteran-musician-digital marketers turned software developers.     Want to see for yourself? Hear from our students as they share their career stories, and see how far they’ve gone as developers!      If you’re looking for a second start and see yourself in any of the above careers or skills, we’d love to help you find your passion.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/how-to-get-started-on-a-programming-exercise/,How to Get Started On Any Programming Exercise - Codeup,"May 18, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsProgramming is hard. Whether you’re just beginning to learn or you’ve been programming for years, you’re going to run into roadblocks and get stuck. Our Data Science Instructor, Ryan Orsinger, has seen 36 cohorts of students come through Codeup and helped build their problem-solving skills through live, audience-centered lectures. Check out his recipe for success below:You’re learning to code, learning the syntax for a programming language, and working on thinking programmatically. The lesson or lecture is completed and now you’re now facing a programming problem that is expecting you to understand and apply the new content. 1. With intent, read the curriculum and the code examples.2. Go back and deliberately read the example code very closely and slowly.3. Copy any example code into your editor.4. Run the example code5. Observe results. Think about each piece of code. What is it doing, what did you expect it to do?6. Try modifying the example code so that you change variables to see different results (one at a time…)If the example code demonstrates how to make a loop from 0 to 9:7. Try removing as many moving pieces from the code for the new concept as possible… try to isolate a unit of work that uses the new concept and test it in isolation8. Read the first exercise problem.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/your-investment-with-codeup/,Your Investment Towards Your Future With Codeup - Codeup,"Jan 29, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsCodeup has trained over 500 software developers over 6 years in San Antonio. But we’re new to town here in Dallas, so we’re getting a lot of questions. Top of that list is, “Why are y’all so much more expensive than the other bootcamps in town?” In case you haven’t noticed, our Full-Stack Web Development program tuition is an investment of $27,500. But the secret is, we don’t cost that much – we’re worth that much. Codeup isn’t a bootcamp – it’s a career accelerator. Tuition is an investment in your future, and the ROI pays off. Let’s dive into why!First of all, the upfront investment to enroll at Codeup is only $1,000 – a down payment to secure your seat. The entirety of the rest of your tuition can be arranged with a combination of scholarships, grants, and loans to support the remaining investment. Our dedicated Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager helps you navigate all the intricacies of tuition planning (if you want to get a head start, read our blog about bootcamp funding, explained).Codeup focuses on quality. While other bootcamps leveraged venture-funding and corporate capital to expand quickly, opening 10+ campuses at a time, Codeup opened one campus. While other programs focused on volume, we focused on quality. We spent five years refining our program before expanding. Here’s the result that you now get to enjoy:If you’re considering a bootcamp education, you’re really considering an investment in yourself. Let’s be really clear – this is NOT school. This isn’t a high school diploma, an Associate’s or a BS in CS. This is a pathway to a career, the salary that will earn, and the meaning it will bring. Put on your investment hat: the upfront $$ isn’t as important as the Return On Investment. Our Dallas-bound graduates have had an average starting salary of $85,000. At less than 6 months long, you still have more than 6 months to work in that year. So what is your ROI? In the same year you are trained, you earn back your money. Within 12 months, you 3x your money.You might ask, why not use that same math on a cheaper program? The answer is simple: other bootcamps don’t view it the same way. They are giving you an education, you are giving them a return on THEIR investment. Let’s take a more specific look:Have more questions about your investment?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/education-is-an-investment/,Your Education is an Investment - Calculating ROI - Codeup,"Aug 17, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsYou have many options regarding educational routes to your desired career path, so why choose Codeup? That’s something only you can decide when it comes to your investment in your education. Some people love that it’s 10x faster than a college degree, others love that you’ll graduate with more projects and experience than many college graduates. Maybe for you, our job placement services, where we help you perfect your resume, LinkedIn, and interview skills, with a whole team dedicated to finding you a job, is worth the $27,500 tuition for Web Development, or $29,500 for Data Science. Or maybe you’ll love the Codeup community, with staff always willing to help you, alumni always willing to mentor you, and even after you graduate, you will continue to see support from Codeup in the form of continuing job placement assistance, events, newsletters, supportive Slack channels, and social media sharing of your coolest projects.Clearly, there are lots of pros to investing in Codeup! There are also potential cons to other routes, such as missed opportunity cost, learning fewer skills across a longer time span, and missing out on work experience while spending more time in another institution. However, what you deem a “pro” and a “con” may look different, and what exactly you prioritize when thinking about large investments will also differ. To get some assistance on how to navigate whether or not Codeup is worth the investment to you, specifically, and to see how Codeup stacks up against other options, please download our PDF: “Education Finance 101: Think of your education as an investment” where we’ll walk you step-by-step through how to measure the return on investment of various educational routes.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/build-your-career-in-tech/,Build Your Career in Tech: Advice from Alumni! - Codeup,"Aug 10, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsBryan Walsh, Codeup Web Development alum, and Misty Garcia, a Codeup Data Science alum, joined Sarah Mellor, Director of Marketing &amp; Admissions, and Stephen Salas, VP of Business Development, in a virtual Zoom event to offer you their insights into building a career in tech. If you’re interested in becoming a Lead Software Developer for a government contractor, like Bryan, or having Misty’s title of Data Management Analyst for a healthcare tech company, keep reading (and watching!) to see how they made that possible.Both panelists were established in their positions before finding Codeup. Misty had been an electrical engineer for 11 years, while Bryan worked in hospitality for 14 years. Both hungry for a change, Bryan found San Antonio before finding Codeup. While answering customer questions about why an application wasn’t working the way it should, Bryan wanted to fix the problems, so he figured out a way to make that his job. Misty, however, first found data science before finding Codeup. Below, Misty discusses what stood out to her about Codeup. Both panelists knew exactly which program they wanted to apply for prior to even finding Codeup, but that isn’t always the case. So, if you’re torn, there are a number of things we’ll help you think about. What are your interests? What is your background in? What are you expected to know before applying vs. before starting? What is your desired timeline? It will really help to talk this out with your admissions manager rather than on your own because you share a common goal, which is for you to succeed in the best program for you. The most important thing you’ll learn at Codeup is how to learn. We can give you a solid foundation in skills like Python or Java, and you’ll learn very quickly. But technology is always changing, and much more important than any singule particular skill is the ability to learn. Here, Bryan hits on how Codeup prepared him to learn new skills that they weren’t explicitly taught in Codeup, but needed on the job. In addition to our curriculum, we also train you on professional development. In the midst of changing career paths so quickly, it can be easy to doubt yourself, or to not know the industry standards and expectations regarding the job search. To help you out, each student is coached professionally, in the ways that Bryan mentions here. In addition to professional development, we also offer job placement assistance. Not only will we help you develop the skills you need to land a job, but our Placement team goes above and beyond to actually make sure you get a job, and that by no means stops after you graduate. Misty didn’t graduate with a job lined up, but still worked closely with the Placement team until she had one. The field of technology is always going to change. You’ll always have to learn new things and you might start to feel like you can’t do it. But Bryan says you just gotta push through. Misty has similar advice, below. Additionally, if you feel like tech is something you can’t do, still apply for Codeup and as you move through the admissions process, allow us to work with you from where you’re at in order to get you to where you need to be. That’s what we’re here for! Be willing! Be willing to be vulnerable, willing to admit what you don’t know, willing to work together, willing to ask for help when you need it. Instructors and admissions staff can’t help you if we don’t know that you need it. But so long as you seek out guidance, even if it means going outside of your comfort zone, we’ll make sure you succeed! And that’s how to build a career in tech! Desire the change, believe in your capacity to do it, follow through with a willingness to learn, and soon enough, you’ll move from entry-level developer to Lead Developer, or from job seeker to helping a company build their first data science team. Codeup is always ready and wanting to help along the way, it just starts with your application! Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/how-to-pick-coding-bootcamp-curriculum/,How To Pick A Coding Bootcamp Curriculum - Codeup,"Jan 30, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsIf you’re thinking about entering a career as a software developer, you’ve probably researched a few different bootcamps. During your research, you’ve probably seen a few different curricula. Without already BEING a software developer, it’s hard to know what’s what. In this post, we want to explore how to think about a bootcamp curriculum and recommend strategies about how to consider the best fit.Let’s start with some terminology. Full-stack web development integrates work on both the front-end and the back-end. The front-end is the user-facing side that you interact within a web browser. The back-end is the server-side that involves the sending and receiving of data. Consider a restaurant website. A front-end only website would show a restaurant menu with prices, dishes, and ordering information. A full-stack web application would allow you to not only view the menu but place an order and process payment information for that order, interacting with a database and back-end functionality.Within that understanding, there are a few groupings of technologies:With so many technologies out there, it can be hard to pick what’s best to learn. But here’s the secret: the specific technologies do not matter. The most important thing you’ll learn during a coding bootcamp is how to use these different categories of technologies. Whether you learn PHP or Java, MySQL, or  SQL Server, the important takeaways are the fundamental concepts learned. Many Codeup alumni graduate from our Full-Stack Java program and go on to work in PHP, Python, Ruby, Groovy, and other languages. Ultimately, a loop is a loop and an array is an array. Languages differ, but once you’ve learned an OOP language, the differences become syntactical instead of conceptual. This leads us to an important point: the more technologies, the worse! The quality of a curriculum, and thus the value of it, is not defined by the number of technologies covered. In fact, it’s the opposite. Let’s give some examples.Columbia University is one of the premier academic institutions in the world. They are an Ivy League university with a strong reputation. In 2018, they expanded into the bootcamp space and launched a web development program that covers the following technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, Database Theory, MongoDB, MySQL, Command Line, Git, and more. All of that in 12 weeks. Let’s decode that for you with the terms we’ve already used. This curriculum promises to teach you:Now let’s look at Codeup. We teach: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Spring, MySQL. All of that, in 22 weeks. In the terms we’ve discussed, that’s: The common initial thought is: why spend 22 weeks learning seven technologies when you could spend 12 weeks learning 10? And there lies the misconception. Many bootcamp curricula promise to teach you the latest and greatest technologies: React.js, Angular.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Node.js, etc. etc. etc. That may sound like a better bang for your buck, but it’s all a question of priority. Here is the reality of your choices:There is no inherently right answer here – it’s all about your priorities. That being said, here’s what we believe: Learning how to learn, learning how to think like a developer, and learning to program is far more important than gaining exposure to the latest web frameworks. When you understand programming fundamentals, you prepare yourself to learn whatever you want. It’s like learning how to work with a car: it’s great to know how to drive an Audi, but it’s pretty different from understanding how an Audi engine works and how it differs from a Honda. At Codeup, we focus on crafting you into a software developer. We focus on programming fundamentals, core web technologies, and applied practices. When you graduate, you’re ready to land a job and have the skills to learn any technology. If that sounds like what you’re looking for, connect with our Admissions Team and we can tell you more! Click here to hear our Codeup Alumnus, Po Lin’s, story about his journey graduating with a Computer Science degree and how he supplemented Codeup’s curriculum to launch a career into software development!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/military-veterans-in-tech/,From Bootcamp to Bootcamp: Veterans Transitioning into Tech,"May 22, 2020 | Behind the Billboards, Tips for Prospective StudentsAre you a veteran or active-duty military member considering your next steps? Our alumni have been in your boots. In a recent virtual panel, two military veterans in tech discussed their transition into the field with Codeup: Benny Fields III, a retired Air Force Master Sergeant turned Full Stack Web Developer, and Jeffery Roeder, a Navy Intelligence Analyst turned Data Scientist. Whether you’re interested in Data Science or Web Development, here are some key takeaways from the event. “The GI Bill was a huge plus, but the icing on the cake was the placement program.” – Benny FieldsAfter retiring from the Air Force, Benny Fields took a job as a technical writer, but he quickly became more interested in the software he was writing about than the writing itself. His friend suggested looking into a coding bootcamp, which he did. He liked that Codeup accepts the GI Bill to help military veterans in tech, and the icing on the cake for him was learning about the work our student placement team does to get you hired.“They’ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed. They have tons of connections- it’s crazy. Colleges aren’t gonna do that for you.” – Jeff RoederWe’ll buff up your resume, set up mock interviews, and give you the know-how to nail your interviews and get a job offer. From how to dress, to what to say in a thank you letter, Jeff said it best: we’ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed in a new career. And it’s backed up by our tuition refund.  “They basically tailored their workshop to me. That’s the kinda stuff that Codeup’s gonna do, they’ll get you there!” – Jeff RoederJeff Roeder heard about Data Science classes at Codeup from a friend who had seen our “crazy billboards” (one of which features Benny). He’s a former intelligence analyst, but the admissions process wasn’t entirely a breeze for him. After studying and studying, Python just wasn’t clicking, and he failed one of his technical assessments. He was about to give up on it, but our admissions team wasn’t ready to give up on him. We personally invited him to one of our Saturday workshops where we taught him step by step how to build the foundation he needed. “They were like ‘hey, you’re gonna learn Spanish and you only have six months to do it,’ which is much like going to Codeup to learn something new, you only have six months to do it.” – Jeff RoederWhen Jeff first joined the Navy as a linguist, he was told to learn Spanish in six months. When he joined Codeup, he was told to learn Data Science in five months. They were both immersive experiences where people of different personalities and different cultures joined together for a common goal. As Jeff put it, you may not always like someone or relate to them, but you need each other to accomplish what needs to get done.“Coming to Codeup, I had to be flexible because I had to learn to adapt to new technologies with new people that were way younger than me and were catching on faster.” – Benny FieldsFor Benny, one similarity is that in the Air Force, you have to be flexible. He was used to having a planned day and changing it at the drop of a hat. In the tech field, things are always changing, and flexibility and constant learning are essential. This is where the military flexibility really came in handy for him.Jeff and Benny may have completed different Codeup programs but they both had the same journey from bootcamp to bootcamp. Both failed their technical assessments at first and had to leverage our resources to get through the admissions process. They both worked with our financial aid team to use their VA benefits for the course, and they both left Codeup with a job and a new skillset. Both are now successful military veterans in tech! If you’re looking for your next step and want to learn more about using VA benefits to attend Codeup, talk with our team today!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/succeed-in-a-coding-bootcamp/,How to Succeed in a Coding Bootcamp: Read Instructor Tips! | Codeup,"Jun 22, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWe held a virtual event called “How to Succeed in a Coding Bootcamp” featuring our Dallas-based Full-Stack Web Development instructors, Douglas Hirsh and Fernando Mendoza. To start our incoming students off on the right foot, we wanted to hear what advice they have to optimize a coding bootcamp experience. Check out their top tips below!“Practical information and practical skills are going to be acquired by practicing every single day.” – FernandoPractice is an essential part of learning something new. You could watch people bake all day long, and still not be any better of a baker yourself. That’s why our students spend more time actually writing code than listening to lectures. You’ll practice alone, with your cohort, and with instructor guidance. Through this practice, you will change the way you think and approach problems. The instructors agreed that practicing on your own through fun side projects, like creating a program to organize your baking recipes, sets the most successful students apart from the rest. “The reason Codeup is every weekday from 9-5 is because we need you to be fully invested. If you only coded on weekends or in your free time, you would forget everything you saw last time and wouldn’t be able to build upon what you know.” – FernandoDon’t just practice. Practice consistently. Many of our students have tried the self-taught route and eventually ended up at Codeup. Why? Practicing every now and then doesn’t cut it when it comes to something as complex as programming, the same way practicing every now and then isn’t how you learn a language or an instrument. The way to succeed at something is by practicing it frequently and consistently. It’s no different for how to succeed in a coding bootcamp. Codeup is fully immersive for that very purpose. “The best thing you can do is the prework that we assign.” – DouglasHelp your future self by doing the prework assigned before the first day of class.. This isn’t just busy work. It’s for you and only you. We won’t take a grade on it, it’s really, entirely, to set yourself up for success. We will move incredibly fast and it will feel like drinking from a firehose, even if you did do the prework. Do future you a big favor by getting used to what drinking from a firehose feels like! “Replace frustration with curiosity, then experimentation.” – FernandoAs you consistently practice the prework, you will come across errors. Instead of getting frustrated, let the errors trigger your curiosity of “why isn’t that working?” and “how do I get it to work?” You can google the keywords in the error message and figure out what to do. This gives you practice problem solving on your own instead of immediately asking someone else for help. While we love helping our students, we will expect you to have already tried to figure things out because we believe in your ability to problem solve. When you do need help, this process helps you frame your questions. We won’t give you answers, but we will happily point to a different way of thinking about an error. It will make getting it right that much more satisfying. “We want you to be in the mindset of understanding and not discovery. The prework is what takes you there.”- FernandoProblem solving your way through the prework allows you to be an active participant in your own learning. You’re giving yourself exposure to a topic before class so that during the lecture, you’re not discovering something new, but trying to understand it. You might not get it the first time you see it, but now you know what to look out for in the lecture. “Think about where you were 5 weeks ago. Use evidence over time that things have gotten better rather than dwelling on failure in the moment. Failure is learning. Failure is good.” – DouglasAs you progress through the program, you will face obstacles and failures, and you will doubt yourself as a programmer. When you feel like you can’t do something, compare yourself to who you were and what you could do 5 weeks ago, instead of comparing yourself to “real programmers.” After reminding yourself of your progress, think about what obstacles are keeping you from moving forward and how to overcome them, instead of defaulting to “I can’t.” Kevin Kelley once said, “Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.”“We have you do group projects and paired programming projects and you get a lot of really good experience working with people remotely. It’s a really good skill to have.” – DouglasProgrammers are not in a room alone all day with 10 screens in front of them. They are frequently communicating with their team, with different teams, and with different clients. You’ll need to know how to storytell and how to present your work and yourself. Throughout the course, you will frequently be working with others and presenting to others. Now that we’ve gone remote, our students are learning to work together from far apart. How successful you are in a coding bootcamp starts with you and how much you’re willing to put in. If you’re ready to continue putting in time and effort, check out our events. Our workshops will give you exposure to code, and our panels will let you hear the perspectives of people who made the same career change you’re hoping for. You got this!

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-student-experience/,Students Discuss Their Transition into Data Science - Codeup,"Jun 5, 2020 | Behind the Billboards, Data ScienceOur Transition into Data Science Panel event was full of passion. The audience met three of our current students: Jada Shipp, formerly a Newborn Hearing Specialist, Daniel Guerrero, who was a Vaccine Product Manager, and Ryan McCall, who was an overnight Surveillance Agent at Walmart. They discussed what led them to this career path, how their Data Science bootcamp experience has been so far, and what they plan to do after Codeup. Read on to learn about the Codeup Data Science bootcamp experience and their key takeaways and advice! The students began by discussing their “whys” and “hows” of pursuing data science at Codeup.Jada: I was going to apply to medical school but decided it wasn’t for me. A friend suggested Codeup, which is how I learned about data science. I realized it’s something I was already interested in. I was really big on solving all my problems in school on Excel and coming up with the best graphs and digging around in numbers. I just didn’t know there was a name for this, and certainly didn’t know it was a career path.Daniel: At a new job as a Vaccine Product Manager, they started asking me to do research about where we’re selling our product and who’s buying. I quickly discovered this was a massive, billion dollar company and there was no one there that actually knew how to use Excel or how to look at sales. It was mind blowing to me because I thought this was standard and everyone was doing it. Then I realized my company is not the only one that has this gap.Ryan: I went to college for chemistry, then started working security but wasn’t satisfied with it. I wanted to use my brain more to think and actively solve problems at my job. So, I started looking at programming as a job career. I found data science and absolutely fell in love with it and spent two years trying to teach it to myself on the side of my security job. It was very hard, I spent most of that time figuring out what resources to trust. It’s a lot easier being taught than searching in the dark. Lots of us know how it feels to come out of a full semester of class feeling like we didn’t absorb anything and not knowing how it applies to real life. Not here.Jada: I thought getting admitted was a mistake and they’d kick me out at any time. I had zero coding experience and I really didn’t think I could do it. But I went step by step. ‘Maybe I can’t do this but I can probably do this one tiny part of it.’ They’ll explain it in as many different ways as they need to until your lightbulb goes on. Daniel: They’ll give you questions that force you to think. They won’t just give you an answer. You have to figure it out yourself but they give you the tools to be able to do that. And because of the collaborative environment, we’re learning from each other as a cohort and not just instructors. Now, I’m able to branch out into new territories and not be scared to do so because I’m well equipped.Ryan: I’m honestly amazed by what we can do in such a short amount of time. I can do things that I thought it would take me years to do. In such an immersive, fast-paced environment, it was a joy to hear how much our students have loved their experience so far.Jada: Everything we do every week, I’m like “This is so cool! Last week was nothing!”Daniel: Every week I have the same conversation with my parents about the program. “What are you doing this week?” “Oh it’s my favorite thing!” “You say that every week!” But other than everything, the projects are the coolest thing for me.Ryan: We could talk about this for hours, we love this stuff! Aside from loving the material, you become like a little family. We’ve had all the same bad experiences, all the same good experiences. You’re speaking a similar language and you can figure it out together. In between lessons, students work closely with our placement team, where we help students land awesome jobs.Jada: I want to use data in health care. I have a degree in Public Health and worked as an EMT, a scribe, and a hearing screener. Now, I want to merge my passion for public health with data science skills. I’m pretty confident I can get a job like this because the Codeup placement team helps you through every step– resume, Linkedin, interview skills. They are not gonna let you fall by the wayside. They remember you and who you are and what you’re looking for. It’s not a generic cookie cutter process where you get what you get. They know you and it’s customized for you.Daniel: I told the placement team that I want to work with data that’s business to customer. Two days later they sent me applications and they’re actually what I asked for, in industries I actually told them about, with companies I actually mentioned. I was mind blown! The placement team will open as many doors as they possibly can to get you the right opportunity, I am more than impressed with the placement team.Ryan: I want to be a data scientist and I don’t know what kind of data scientist, I just want to be one! And they can work with that, too! All three panelists said the same thing: DO THE PREWORK!   We want to thank Jada, Daniel, and Ryan for sharing their passion with us and acting as mentors for prospective and current students for the night. They are each blossoming into data scientists that couldn’t hide how much they love what they do even if they tried. Do you want a similar transition? Start your own Data Science bootcamp experience today by learning more. Scared it’s too risky and you won’t get a job? That’s okay, we’ll refund your tuition if you don’t. Any more excuses? There won’t be once you give us a call. Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/the-message-behind-our-billboards/,The Message Behind Our Billboards - Codeup,"Sep 17, 2018 | Behind the Billboards, Codeup NewsYou may have seen Codeup’s billboards around town featuring recent career transitioners. We’ve featured former law students, baristas, hairstylists, military veterans, and more. We’ve recently heard that the advertising has offended people from those professions, so we want to explain our message more clearly.Codeup’s mission is to help individuals in transition change their futures by providing a fast and effective entry point into a tech career. We believe that everyone should have access to the new tech economy and that you don’t need any specific background to do so.That’s why we feature REAL graduates of our program who have started new careers from a diverse set of backgrounds. Luke used to be a soldier, Mars was a barista and bartender, John was studying law, and Sukari was a hairstylist. We’re not saying those weren’t real jobs! And we’re not saying software development is better for you. We ARE saying that each of our students chose software development for their own reasons. We highlight those stories to show that YOU, regardless of what career you have now, CAN become a software developer IF that’s what you want.Don’t just listen to us – listen to the real students whose stories are up on those billboards!PREVIOUS HAIRSTYLIST AND CODEUP ALUMNA, SUKARI S., EXCITED TO SEE HER BILLBOARD COPY GOING UP THIS PAST MAY!PREVIOUS HAIRSTYLIST AND CODEUP ALUMNA, SUKARI S., EXCITED TO SEE HER BILLBOARD COPY GOING UP THIS PAST MAY!Sukari S. (Previously a Hair Stylist): “I discovered I really liked software development: the process, the code… I wanted to immerse myself fully into it, so I decided to go to Codeup to better myself with a new career. Codeup changed my life for the best. It made my career transition as smooth as possible, and I’m super grateful. Now I have weekends back to spend with my toddler son!”John H. (Previously studying Law): “I was in law school simply for the reason it seemed like the next logical step for my degree. Like a lot of people trying new things, once I got into it I discovered it wasn’t for me. When I started seeing the Codeup billboards, it gave me another option for something I could do that I had never tried before. It was something that could offer me a good, solid, steady career that I hadn’t considered. By no means is a law degree bad – lots of people are lawyers and take care of themselves. It’s just that Codeup was there to offer an alternative when I needed one.”Amy Y. (Previously an Admissions Counselor): “I went into higher education because I had so many years of personal experience going through admissions, applying for financial aid, and planning my degree plan, and I enjoyed helping others through this process as well. However, even with a Master’s degree, I was in very entry-level positions and struggled for many years to advance to higher positions. I didn’t feel like my skill set or passion was being appreciated, so a programmer friend of mine directed me to Codeup. The transition into the tech industry has been life-changing, and as a programmer in my current job, I feel personally valued on a daily basis. The path for growth and advancement is clear, and I’m never looking back!”We believe that each person should choose their own path, and degrees and diplomas don’t define you.

Learn all the technical skills you need to get hired within 6 months of graduating, or get your tuition back.*If your toilet is acting up, you call a plumber, not someone with a PhD in Fluid Dynamics to learn how the physics messed up your pipes. Graduate degrees are set up to where you learn about pipe theory, then the history of the wrench, then the physics of water. But in the tech world, knowledge on theory won’t get you very far.In grad school, you’ll spend a fortune learning theory about statistics, then algorithms, then the history and evolution of applied machine learning. However, you won’t have many tangible skills or projects to show potential employers. Not here. Our hands-on, project-based curriculum is crafted by employers and set up to let you practice how to actually fix things so you can be the best data scientist you can be.Build the skills, not just the knowledge. Learn how to think, not just how things work. Become an expert, don’t just watch one. If you want an awesome salary and a fulfilling career in a booming industry, we can make you a data scientist fast, with no experience necessary.Though some job listings for data scientists require a Bachelor’s degree, many of them don’t, and those that do often don’t care what your degree is in. As long as there’s evidence that you have the right skills, you’re employable. And building skills is what we’re all about. You’ll have plenty of projects to show off to potential employers which will put you way ahead of the game. Employers can’t waste their time training candidates that have knowledge but not skill. That’s why we’re here!In fact, we have students come to Codeup every year because they finished their degrees but couldn’t get hired. Some even have a Master’s degree and above. Others get just as great of jobs with no degree.62%Have an Bachelor’s Degree16%Have an Master’s Degree3%Have a Doctorate19%Do not have a degree 670+Curriculum Hours 22Week Program100% 2019 Employement RateTell our placement team what kind of job you want, and they’ll send you applications, help build your resume and LinkedIn, and practice interviews with you to help you get the job.

https://codeup.com/data-science-student-experience/,Students Discuss Their Transition into Data Science - Codeup,"Jun 5, 2020 | Behind the Billboards, Data ScienceOur Transition into Data Science Panel event was full of passion. The audience met three of our current students: Jada Shipp, formerly a Newborn Hearing Specialist, Daniel Guerrero, who was a Vaccine Product Manager, and Ryan McCall, who was an overnight Surveillance Agent at Walmart. They discussed what led them to this career path, how their Data Science bootcamp experience has been so far, and what they plan to do after Codeup. Read on to learn about the Codeup Data Science bootcamp experience and their key takeaways and advice! The students began by discussing their “whys” and “hows” of pursuing data science at Codeup.Jada: I was going to apply to medical school but decided it wasn’t for me. A friend suggested Codeup, which is how I learned about data science. I realized it’s something I was already interested in. I was really big on solving all my problems in school on Excel and coming up with the best graphs and digging around in numbers. I just didn’t know there was a name for this, and certainly didn’t know it was a career path.Daniel: At a new job as a Vaccine Product Manager, they started asking me to do research about where we’re selling our product and who’s buying. I quickly discovered this was a massive, billion dollar company and there was no one there that actually knew how to use Excel or how to look at sales. It was mind blowing to me because I thought this was standard and everyone was doing it. Then I realized my company is not the only one that has this gap.Ryan: I went to college for chemistry, then started working security but wasn’t satisfied with it. I wanted to use my brain more to think and actively solve problems at my job. So, I started looking at programming as a job career. I found data science and absolutely fell in love with it and spent two years trying to teach it to myself on the side of my security job. It was very hard, I spent most of that time figuring out what resources to trust. It’s a lot easier being taught than searching in the dark. Lots of us know how it feels to come out of a full semester of class feeling like we didn’t absorb anything and not knowing how it applies to real life. Not here.Jada: I thought getting admitted was a mistake and they’d kick me out at any time. I had zero coding experience and I really didn’t think I could do it. But I went step by step. ‘Maybe I can’t do this but I can probably do this one tiny part of it.’ They’ll explain it in as many different ways as they need to until your lightbulb goes on. Daniel: They’ll give you questions that force you to think. They won’t just give you an answer. You have to figure it out yourself but they give you the tools to be able to do that. And because of the collaborative environment, we’re learning from each other as a cohort and not just instructors. Now, I’m able to branch out into new territories and not be scared to do so because I’m well equipped.Ryan: I’m honestly amazed by what we can do in such a short amount of time. I can do things that I thought it would take me years to do. In such an immersive, fast-paced environment, it was a joy to hear how much our students have loved their experience so far.Jada: Everything we do every week, I’m like “This is so cool! Last week was nothing!”Daniel: Every week I have the same conversation with my parents about the program. “What are you doing this week?” “Oh it’s my favorite thing!” “You say that every week!” But other than everything, the projects are the coolest thing for me.Ryan: We could talk about this for hours, we love this stuff! Aside from loving the material, you become like a little family. We’ve had all the same bad experiences, all the same good experiences. You’re speaking a similar language and you can figure it out together. In between lessons, students work closely with our placement team, where we help students land awesome jobs.Jada: I want to use data in health care. I have a degree in Public Health and worked as an EMT, a scribe, and a hearing screener. Now, I want to merge my passion for public health with data science skills. I’m pretty confident I can get a job like this because the Codeup placement team helps you through every step– resume, Linkedin, interview skills. They are not gonna let you fall by the wayside. They remember you and who you are and what you’re looking for. It’s not a generic cookie cutter process where you get what you get. They know you and it’s customized for you.Daniel: I told the placement team that I want to work with data that’s business to customer. Two days later they sent me applications and they’re actually what I asked for, in industries I actually told them about, with companies I actually mentioned. I was mind blown! The placement team will open as many doors as they possibly can to get you the right opportunity, I am more than impressed with the placement team.Ryan: I want to be a data scientist and I don’t know what kind of data scientist, I just want to be one! And they can work with that, too! All three panelists said the same thing: DO THE PREWORK!   We want to thank Jada, Daniel, and Ryan for sharing their passion with us and acting as mentors for prospective and current students for the night. They are each blossoming into data scientists that couldn’t hide how much they love what they do even if they tried. Do you want a similar transition? Start your own Data Science bootcamp experience today by learning more. Scared it’s too risky and you won’t get a job? That’s okay, we’ll refund your tuition if you don’t. Any more excuses? There won’t be once you give us a call. Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/subjects/front-end,Front-end vs Back-end - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective StudentsWe can differentiate between front-end and back-end development easily by understanding that web designers focus on the design, typography, colors, etc. (front-end development), while web programmers focus on back-end development using specific languages (MySQL, PHP, other database languages, etc). Front-end = what you see; back-end = how it works.These days, front-end development refers to the part of the web users interact with. In the past, web development consisted of people who worked with Photoshop and those who could code HTML and CSS. Now, developers need a handle of programs like Photoshop and coding in not only in HTML and CSS, but also JavaScript or jQuery (a compiled library of JavaScript).Websites combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all controlled by the browser. For example, if you use Google Chrome or Firefox, the browser translates all of the code in a manner for you to see and interact with, such as fonts, colors, drop-down menus, sliders, forms, etc. In order for all of this to work, though, something has to support the front-end; here the backend comes into play.In a previous blog, we talked about how web programmers are concerned with launching websites, updates, and maintenance, among other things. All of that works to support the front-end of the website. The back-end has three parts to it: server, application, and database.To better explain, let’s use the example of a customer trying to purchase a plane ticket using a website. Everything that the customer sees on the webpage is the front-end. However, once the customer enters all of their information (ie. their name, billing address, destination, etc), the web application stores the information in a database that was created previously on the server where the website is calling for information.The web application creates, deletes, changes, renames, etc items in the database. For example, when a customer purchases a ticket, that creates an item in the database, but when they change their order or they wish to cancel, they change the item in the database.A server, in the simplest form, is a computer accessed remotely that runs software to fulfill requests from clients. In our example, the server the customer’s browser is communicating with is where the database is stored and modified.When a customer wants to buy a ticket, the backend operation web application communicates with the server to make a change in a database stored on said server. Backend programmers use technologies like Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and others to make this communication work smoothly, allowing the customer to purchase his or her ticket with ease.Many of these technologies relate to eachother. They all work together to make something work. Some developers can program for both front-end and back-end. However, it takes much more time to design while programming the back-end. It all depends on the project and what technologies and skills are needed where.Which do you prefer? Does front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interest you more? Or do you see yourself as a back-end champion tackling technologies like PHP, Python, and Ruby? Whichever your choice, you can learn how to use these programming languages in Codeup. Our classes focus on Java and client-side JavaScript; This leaves room for our graduates to decide whether they would like to pursue front-end or back-end development.For the next blog, we will talk about being a full stack developer and what that entails.Interested in learning in becoming a software developer?

After you apply for a loan, we’ll help you set up your repayment account.

You can choose to pay the minimum monthly payment, or you can make larger payments. You have the flexibility to pay off your loan anytime before your loan term ends.Ascent offers several repayment options.Aspire and Launch are the loan servicers for Ascent’s loans. This means Aspire or Launch will collect your monthly payments during the repayment phase of your loan. All loans applied for on or before June 9th, 2019 will be serviced by Aspire. All loans applied for on or after June 10th, 2019 will be serviced by Launch.Need to pay your loan?

Please refer to your school’s refund policies and student agreements. If your school offers an employment guarantee refund, the terms and requirements set therein, as well as the decision to extend a refund in such a scenario, is solely at the discretion of your school. Please contact your school for any questions regarding an employment guarantee refund or a standard refund.Regarding your borrowed tuition funds:No, they’re consumer loans to help pay for tuition or cost of living at our partner schools.There are several key differences, and we encourage applicants to perform their own research into this topic. However, some of the high-level differences between an Ascent consumer loan for bootcamps and a private student loan include:Yes, you can add a cosigner to your loan. There are two ways to qualify for an Ascent bootcamp loan: on your own, or with a cosigner. Depending upon your credit health, a cosigner might be required. Cosigners may strengthen your application’s overall credit health. In some scenarios, adding a cosigner may reduce your interest rate and lower your payments. If you’re concerned about your eligibility for an Ascent loan, consider adding a cosigner with strong credit health.You can choose to add a cosigner before you submit your loan application, or may be given the option to add a cosigner after you apply.If you’d like to add a cosigner when you apply, you can select this option in the application. If your cosigner is with you, they can start their portion of the application right away. If not, we’ll send them an email asking them to complete their part. Your cosigner’s portion of the application will look very similar to yours.We’ll keep you and your cosigner updated on the status of your application throughout the process. You’ll receive an email or a notification in the application if you or your cosigner have any required steps to take.You will be charged an origination fee of 5.0%. This will be added to the amount you borrow and is included in the total loan principal amount you finance. It helps cover the administrative fees associated with originating the loan. It is the only fee charged for taking out this loan, and it affects your loan’s Annual Percentage Rate. See exampleYes, you can request to cancel or decrease your loan after you apply. Log in to your Ascent account at bootcamp.ascentfunding.com or reach out to [email protected] to request changes to your loan.If funds haven’t been sent to your school, Ascent can easily process a request to cancel or decrease your loan.  If funds have already been sent to your school, we’ll follow your school’s refund policy.Please note that Ascent can’t increase your loan amount after you apply. Instead, you may be able to cancel your loan and reapply for a greater loan amount.Our goal at Ascent is to help students from all walks of life and with a broad range of backgrounds get access to the programs that interest them. We offer two possible ways to qualify for an Ascent loan: on your own or with a cosigner.To see if you pre-qualify for an Ascent bootcamp loan, submit an application. In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score. In addition to learning more about your eligibility, you can also see the rates and terms you pre-qualify for.Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or DACA recipients with established credit history &amp; no outstanding education loan defaults. U.S. temporary residents may apply with a creditworthy cosigner that is a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident.Adding a cosigner can help strengthen your application’s overall credit health, and may even help lower your loan’s interest rate, APR, or monthly payments.While our application process asks for income and employment details, we won’t use income, employment, or your requested loan amount to evaluate your application.Yes. Individuals may apply as a borrower or cosigner based on their citizenship status as follows:Documentation requirements: The following are documentation will be required to verify your individual resident status:A VISA that does not expire within 6-months of the end of the enrollment period for which the loan is being requested. with an acceptable category as follows:  F-1, F-3, G Series, H-1B, H-1C, H-3, J-1, L-1, M-1, M-3, T-1, TNORAn I-20 Form (pages 1 &amp; 2 and signed by the school) and an unexpired passport from country of origin.You can submit an application and become pre-qualified as early as 90 days before your program. Pre-qualification allows you to preview your rates and loan options. In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score. Before accepting a loan option, please ensure you have enrolled in your program.Yes, you can prepay your loan at any time without penalty. You have the flexibility to make early payments or fully pay off your loan without prepayment fees.Your interest rate is the base cost of borrowing money for the duration of your loan and is a percentage of the principal loan amount. It can be fixed (it will not change) or variable (it could change over time). Variable interest rates can increase or decrease throughout the life of your loan, which may result in your monthly payment changing over time. All Ascent loans for Codeup are fixed rate – your rate won’t go up!To see the status of your loan application, visit your Ascent account dashboard at bootcamp.ascentfunding.com. We’ll also send you emails throughout the process to keep you updated. You can save your progress in the application and return to it at any time.No, you can reduce your total cost by making early payments! This is a benefit we hope our borrowers take advantage of. When you apply for a loan, we show you as many details as we can upfront. One of those details is the total cost of the loan, which is the total amount you’ll pay over the scheduled lifetime of the loan. Our calculation of the total cost assumes that you will pay off your loan by making monthly on-time minimum payments for your entire loan term, which is either 36 or 60 months. The total cost includes (1) the origination fee of 5% of your loan amount, (2) the loan amount, and (3) the interest accrued over the lifetime of the loan.With our loans, you can make early payments or fully pay off your loan at any time with no prepayment fees. Many of our borrowers graduate from their programs, land jobs, and pay off their loans early! This is a financially smart move, because if you make early payments, you’ll accrue less interest over the lifetime of your loan. In summary – we don’t hold you to the total cost you see in your loan offers. If you make early payments, you can reduce the interest you accrue, which reduces your loan’s total cost!Richland State Bank, member FDIC, is the lender for all Ascent loans.For any additional questions, please complete this form.We'll send you our step-by-step guide to paying for your program.Skills Fund, LLC (d/b/a Ascent Skills Funding) products are made available through Richland State Bank, Member FDIC.2021 © Ascent Skills Funding.All Rights Reserved.We reserve the right to modify or discontinue (in whole or in part) these loan programs and their associated services and benefits at any time without notice.

Please refer to your school’s refund policies and student agreements. If your school offers an employment guarantee refund, the terms and requirements set therein, as well as the decision to extend a refund in such a scenario, is solely at the discretion of your school. Please contact your school for any questions regarding an employment guarantee refund or a standard refund.Regarding your borrowed tuition funds:No, they’re consumer loans to help pay for tuition or cost of living at our partner schools.There are several key differences, and we encourage applicants to perform their own research into this topic. However, some of the high-level differences between an Ascent consumer loan for bootcamps and a private student loan include:Yes, you can add a cosigner to your loan. There are two ways to qualify for an Ascent bootcamp loan: on your own, or with a cosigner. Depending upon your credit health, a cosigner might be required. Cosigners may strengthen your application’s overall credit health. In some scenarios, adding a cosigner may reduce your interest rate and lower your payments. If you’re concerned about your eligibility for an Ascent loan, consider adding a cosigner with strong credit health.You can choose to add a cosigner before you submit your loan application, or may be given the option to add a cosigner after you apply.If you’d like to add a cosigner when you apply, you can select this option in the application. If your cosigner is with you, they can start their portion of the application right away. If not, we’ll send them an email asking them to complete their part. Your cosigner’s portion of the application will look very similar to yours.We’ll keep you and your cosigner updated on the status of your application throughout the process. You’ll receive an email or a notification in the application if you or your cosigner have any required steps to take.You will be charged an origination fee of 5.0%. This will be added to the amount you borrow and is included in the total loan principal amount you finance. It helps cover the administrative fees associated with originating the loan. It is the only fee charged for taking out this loan, and it affects your loan’s Annual Percentage Rate. See exampleYes, you can request to cancel or decrease your loan after you apply. Log in to your Ascent account at bootcamp.ascentfunding.com or reach out to [email protected] to request changes to your loan.If funds haven’t been sent to your school, Ascent can easily process a request to cancel or decrease your loan.  If funds have already been sent to your school, we’ll follow your school’s refund policy.Please note that Ascent can’t increase your loan amount after you apply. Instead, you may be able to cancel your loan and reapply for a greater loan amount.Our goal at Ascent is to help students from all walks of life and with a broad range of backgrounds get access to the programs that interest them. We offer two possible ways to qualify for an Ascent loan: on your own or with a cosigner.To see if you pre-qualify for an Ascent bootcamp loan, submit an application. In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score. In addition to learning more about your eligibility, you can also see the rates and terms you pre-qualify for.Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or DACA recipients with established credit history &amp; no outstanding education loan defaults. U.S. temporary residents may apply with a creditworthy cosigner that is a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident.Adding a cosigner can help strengthen your application’s overall credit health, and may even help lower your loan’s interest rate, APR, or monthly payments.While our application process asks for income and employment details, we won’t use income, employment, or your requested loan amount to evaluate your application.Yes. Individuals may apply as a borrower or cosigner based on their citizenship status as follows:Documentation requirements: The following are documentation will be required to verify your individual resident status:A VISA that does not expire within 6-months of the end of the enrollment period for which the loan is being requested. with an acceptable category as follows:  F-1, F-3, G Series, H-1B, H-1C, H-3, J-1, L-1, M-1, M-3, T-1, TNORAn I-20 Form (pages 1 &amp; 2 and signed by the school) and an unexpired passport from country of origin.You can submit an application and become pre-qualified as early as 90 days before your program. Pre-qualification allows you to preview your rates and loan options. In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score. Before accepting a loan option, please ensure you have enrolled in your program.Yes, you can prepay your loan at any time without penalty. You have the flexibility to make early payments or fully pay off your loan without prepayment fees.Your interest rate is the base cost of borrowing money for the duration of your loan and is a percentage of the principal loan amount. It can be fixed (it will not change) or variable (it could change over time). Variable interest rates can increase or decrease throughout the life of your loan, which may result in your monthly payment changing over time. All Ascent loans for Codeup are fixed rate – your rate won’t go up!To see the status of your loan application, visit your Ascent account dashboard at bootcamp.ascentfunding.com. We’ll also send you emails throughout the process to keep you updated. You can save your progress in the application and return to it at any time.No, you can reduce your total cost by making early payments! This is a benefit we hope our borrowers take advantage of. When you apply for a loan, we show you as many details as we can upfront. One of those details is the total cost of the loan, which is the total amount you’ll pay over the scheduled lifetime of the loan. Our calculation of the total cost assumes that you will pay off your loan by making monthly on-time minimum payments for your entire loan term, which is either 36 or 60 months. The total cost includes (1) the origination fee of 5% of your loan amount, (2) the loan amount, and (3) the interest accrued over the lifetime of the loan.With our loans, you can make early payments or fully pay off your loan at any time with no prepayment fees. Many of our borrowers graduate from their programs, land jobs, and pay off their loans early! This is a financially smart move, because if you make early payments, you’ll accrue less interest over the lifetime of your loan. In summary – we don’t hold you to the total cost you see in your loan offers. If you make early payments, you can reduce the interest you accrue, which reduces your loan’s total cost!Richland State Bank, member FDIC, is the lender for all Ascent loans.For any additional questions, please complete this form.We'll send you our step-by-step guide to paying for your program.Skills Fund, LLC (d/b/a Ascent Skills Funding) products are made available through Richland State Bank, Member FDIC.2021 © Ascent Skills Funding.All Rights Reserved.We reserve the right to modify or discontinue (in whole or in part) these loan programs and their associated services and benefits at any time without notice.

Our grads leverage a 99% employment rate, an average time of 2.1 weeks to hire, and partners like Oracle, USAA, Cognizant, and Accenture. All of that is backed up by the fact that we publish our outcomes through the Texas Workforce Commission and Council for Integrity in Results and Reporting. Tech Talent South does not publish outcomes, so there is no available data on employment rate, time to hire, starting salary, job titles, or anything else.Take the cost of tuition and divide that by the number of hours spent in the classroom and you’ll find that you’re investing $41 per hour at Codeup. Do the same math with Tech Talent South and you’ll find you’re spending $52 per hour – and that’s not backed up by a tuition refund guarantee.Codeup partners with 8 financial aid providers, including 4 grant partners, 3 loan partners, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. We also offer nearly $200k in scholarships annually. If you’re just looking for a new skill, you can click that back button. If you want a career in software development, Codeup is right for you.

After launching our first class in February 2014, we’ve now successfully trained 574 alumni. So while the streets might look different around 75202, the code looks the same. To anyone nervous about trusting us ‘newbies’ with your careers, meet the incredible team of software development mentors you’ll get to learn from. Professionally, Douglas Hirsh and Fernando Mendoza have over 30 years of industry experience between them. They’ve worked at household names like CitiBank and bring a wide range of diverse industry experience across gaming, oil, and SAAS. Combined, they also bring nearly 10 years of formal teaching experience. Fernando worked as an instructor over the weekends while he was going through University for four years, and is also one of our most tenured instructors with almost 4 years of Codeup experience under his belt. PS, that’s over 20 cohorts and 400 students! Douglas is a life long mentor, but also taught at another coding bootcamp earlier in his career before joining Codeup.Technically, the pair is experienced in a wide range of languages and technologies, including: But what’s our favorite part of this dynamic duo? They come from opposite ends of the development world. Douglas is a self-taught programmer. He started self-teaching at the age of 12 with a C++ book, and by the time he was 19 he was being paid to write code. Over the next 18 years, Douglas worked his way up to a Senior Developer and even a Chief Technology Officer. So although he wasn’t formally trained, Douglas knows not only the ins and outs of software development, but he also knows first-hand what it’s like to self-teach, learn on the job, and follow a non-traditional career path.Fernando has also been programming since he was 15. He then received his BS in Computer Systems Engineering from the Institute of Technology in Uruapan, Mexico. Over the next 12 years, he progressed from a Jr. Developer to a Senior Web Developer. He even has his own freelance web development agency. With his formal background, Fernando brings deep expertise in software architecture, database design and administration, and CS theory.When you join Codeup Dallas, you first and foremost join a classroom to learn alongside Senior Developers with 30+ years of practical experience and 10+ years of teaching experience.

Now, we’re excited to bring our mission of creating pathways to Software Development and Data Science careers to more people.

Meanwhile, we believe the outcomes of our graduates far outweigh the number of campuses we have. We have refined our curriculum, built our team, expanded our partnership network, and built a brand people can trust. Where did we all end up? Many of our competitors have closed or sold. We’re still Texas-based, owned by our founders, and our investment in quality has brought our graduate placement rate to 97% over the last 18 months. So what’s next?With our product refined, we were ready to expand. We looked at cities all over the country, but quickly realized we didn’t want a second Codeup, or a third. Instead, we need additional campuses to belong to one cohesive Codeup. So we didn’t pick a city, we picked a state. Texas has the 10th largest economy in the world and has over 50 company headquarters from the Fortune 500 list. All four of our major cities (Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio) have high demand for tech talent, offer a welcoming place to live and do business, and are home to a large veteran population ready for the jobs of tomorrow. We are not creating a second Codeup, but we are opening another campus. The time is right, and Texas is ready. Dallas jumped to the top of our list to start with because we’ve already placed our graduates there at companies like USAA and Cognizant for average starting salaries of $86,666. We focus on job outcomes, so we go where our partnerships lead. That way, we can live our mission of empowering life change and launching careers in technology.We’ve secured a space in the heart of downtown Dallas, where students will have access to vibrant city life and dozens of employers.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/post-codeup-update-steven-starnes/,Post Codeup Update: Steven Starnes - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Alumni StoriesLess than a month ago, we graduated our first cohort of budding web developers and had them show off their web applications to a venue full of potential employers. We have been keeping in touch with our students and have been helping them in any way that we can. Half of the class has already found employment, working for companies like ParLevel Systems, Digett, and Wickley Interactive.Steven Starnes, a photographer turned web developer, thought it would be a good idea to do an internship for a non-profit to learn different technologies, hone his skills, and give back to his community.We sent him an email recently and asked him some questions about his post-Codeup life. Here are his answers:I am interning for Haven for Hope.I am building applications solving internal and external problems including database issues and website maintenance.I’m working with enterprise level code using the .NET framework, MS SQL, and C#/Razor. I’m using Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server for source control. I am honing my skills with some JavaScript libraries, such as Angular.js, moment.js, and jQuery.I am coding in a completely different environment than what was taught at Codeup. The concepts and foundation that Codeup provided is allowing me to rapidly pick up the new environment with ease.I would like to work for a large company, such as Rackspace (applied), SACU, Whataburger, etc. This will be a tougher challenge as their requirements are a lot steeper than most smaller companies or startups. However, I have applied to several smaller companies/startups with no response yet.Keep your head in the game. If you don’t understand something or you are just getting by, grab an instructor, attend study hall, get to where you understand it. The lessons you learn during the day, when you get home at night, re-type them until you understand them.Best of luck to Steven Starnes on his journey as a web developer!

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/student-blog-josue-plaza/,Student Blog - Josue Plaza - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Alumni Stories Josue Plaza is a student in our current cohort, codenamed “Badlands.” He has a creative background and writes music for video games. We’re very happy to have him be a part of our class. He recently wrote a blog for us about why he wants to do Codeup:About two weeks ago, I had spent an afternoon planning my summer class schedule at Texas State University. This schedule had to be well-defined, ensuring I would have enough time to commute to San Marcos in the morning then drive back to San Antonio for my day job. It was a painstaking process, but I had finally cultivated the perfect schedule to fit my needs.Why? What is Codeup? Why am I deciding to stall my college education to take courses in a bootcamp about programming?At Texas State University, I spent that last three years working at the college radio station. Eventually, I was hired to become the production director in charge of managing a staff of over 30 volunteers and overseeing the production, implementation, and scheduling of all radio spots for airtime. When my term finished, I realized that deep-down in my heart that I loved working there because of the people, but I did not enjoy the work. Naturally, this terrified me. Here I am, roughly 30 credit hours away from a bachelor degree in a field I no longer have an interest in participating. I needed to get a job out of college. What else could a mass communication degree point me towards?It’s no secret that the computer science industry is booming. We live in a time where we are witnessing ground-breaking innovation in technology on a daily basis.This has not only altered the world around us, but also how we interact with it and each other. Thirty years ago, maintaining a business was a primarily brick-and-mortar venture. If you had a dream to start selling clothes, you invest in a shop downtown and work harder to become popular in your city. Today, you can create the business from the luxury of your home and reach an exponential amount of customers. You can use tracking analytical tools to find out what items your customers are most interested in, then place advertisements to better tailor their interests. You can supply niche markets with products and be able to sustain yourself. You can even create your own start-up company to satisfy a new and upcoming demand.The craziest part about the industry is how accessible is it to break in to. Your educational background comes second to your experience and knowledge about development. Because of the rapidly evolving environment, traditional curriculum cannot keep up with the demand for web development related careers. At Texas State University, the most coding-oriented class offered was basic web design (when I return for the fall semester, a new class known as “Coding and Data Skills” will be available).Codeup is a full-time course that teaches you web development. Plain and simple. They are not an accredited institution with a traditional curriculum, and everything about them is revolutionary. (Editor’s note: As an independent school, Codeup is licensed and regulated by the Texas Workforce Commission, approved by the Department of Veteran Affairs, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting.)Although the class is made up of about 20-30 students, there are at least 3 instructors per cohort that are available to aid the students whenever they need it (a student ratio which absolutely stomps on my university’s 300+ student-per-teacher ratios). They also provide consistent review sessions every day. If you have someplace to be during the weekdays, you can review with other students on Saturdays, all optional but available for any student that needs extra guidance.At first, I was extremely hesitant to take part in this unusual course structure. However, after my first week, I have become extremely motivated and even excited to finish and pursue a career in this field.For me, the most important factors are to feel the magic as I begin my programming journey and realize I could be doing this every day if done for a living. The instructors told us once that successful programmers code because they love it. I can say for me that it was love at first sight.We are looking forward to seeing how he grows as a developer and what he builds in the future! Good luck, Josue!Bio:Josue is a 21-year old senior at Texas State University. He was the production director for KTSW 89.9FM college radio station, producing hundreds of radio spots while directing a team of 20-30 volunteer staff. Under his leadership and production experience, the KTSW production department received three first-place awards: 2014 Winner for Best Radio Production (TIPA), 2014 Winner for Best Radio PSA (TIPA), and 2013 Winner for Best PSA for Cyber Security Awareness (South Central NBS). He has a strong passion for music in video games &amp; film. In his free time, Josue produces for bands, singer-songwriters, and hip-hop artists. He also DJs and performs as Ex Gratia with singer-songwriter Kimberly Witthaus.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/5-hiring-trends-in-software-development/,5 Hiring Trends in Software Development - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development Companies (and ideal candidates) care about solving problems for the end user.Hiring needs in the tech industry – specifically on software development teams – evolve almost as quickly as the technologies themselves. One year employers are trying to get their hands on Ruby developers, and 12 months later, a new JavaScript framework is all the buzz. This doesn’t make things easy for job seekers or new employers looking to hire their first software developers.Drawing on conversations with our 200+ employer partners at Codeup, we’ve compiled a shortlist of five trends we’ve seen emerge recently. In a nutshell, it’s all about solving problems for the end user.First, what is Agile? In a nutshell, it’s a set of management practices that allows software developers to write code and build products more efficiently.Agile has gained serious ground in IT departments across a variety of industries, from finance to food service. While Agile doesn’t explicitly require a team of full stack developers, it does ask developers to be fully engaged in all facets of building an application, from creating user stories to deployment. As a result, roles on an Agile team start to blur, and each individual winds up working on features across the tech stack.=There’s no doubt that a team of specialized front-end and back-end developers can build great software. However, today’s hiring managers seem to have a preference for full stack developers, or at least those who understand both sides of a given tech stack, because these well-rounded employees have a leg up on others in an Agile environment.Structure and efficiency are still important for software engineers to get right, but more and more, it’s critical for developers to code across the stack with the end user at top of mind. In fact, Agile teams dedicate time to create user stories that inform the products they build, and each team member is involved in a recurring (or iterative) design process.Tim Brown, the CEO of international design firm IDEO, says, “Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.”Software is everywhere these days, and it’s not just for techies. Solutions need to be slick, innovative, and easy-to-use. The latest version of iOS or Android needs to be impressive enough for tech enthusiasts to get excited about and straightforward enough for grandpa to check his voicemail. Most importantly, good developers realize those two things aren’t mutually exclusive.Now more than ever, a strong understanding of JavaScript can really help software developers land a great job.Once a fairly basic, client-side scripting language, JavaScript has made powerful gains in functionality while staying lean and efficient. In recent years, Node.js, a server-side runtime, has transformed JavaScript into a full stack powerhouse.JavaScript continues to deliver on the front-end, too: React.js has revolutionized user interface development and has become the front-end JavaScript framework of choice for Fortune 500 companies and startups alike.Diversity in tech remains elusive and persists as a key talking point in the industry. Women, as well as black, Latinx, and LGBT workers, remain severely underrepresented. In light of this year’s high-profile headlines on gender diversity issues at Uber and Google, many tech companies have doubled down on their commitments to boost workplace equality and employ people who authentically empathize with a diverse group of end users.We’ve also noticed a growing trend toward diversity initiatives that aim to include nontraditional hires like military veterans, career changers, and candidates without four-year degrees. For example, the Microsoft LEAP initiative seeks candidates who have tech experience but may have been out of work for a while (e.g., stay-at-home moms or dads) or career changers with at least six months of software development experience.This is less of a hiring trend than it is a skill that employers continue to require of all new developers, especially non-traditional hires who may not have a computer science degree or years of experience.Software developers – especially those new to the field – are in a constant state of learning new technologies and solving problems they’ve never encountered before. The ability to define a problem, recognize key inputs, and identify potential solutions is particularly important when the quality of a line of code depends on the developer’s ability to think logically and efficiently.Interviewers often ask candidates to walk through a scenario, usually a past experience or a hypothetical case study, where the candidate needs to demonstrate their ability to assess a problem and formulate a solution. Sometimes these questions can be technical and quantitative, other times they’re more behavioral, but either way, it’s clear that companies want employees who think well on their feet and come to their managers with solutions instead of self-explanatory questions.Beyond these trends, employers continue to look for one thing above all else: technical skills! Before learning a new JavaScript framework and doing research on best practices for design thinking, you’ve got to have the fundamentals of software development under your belt. That’s where Codeup comes in. Our 18-week career accelerator gives you all the tools and training you need to capitalize on these trends and land a great job as a software developer.To learn more about Codeup, email us at info@codeup.com or apply today! Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/6-seo-tips-from-seo-guru-matt-egan/,"6 SEO Tips From SEO Guru, Matt Egan - Codeup","Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective StudentsLast Thursday, Matt Egan, founder of San Antonio-based Search Engine Optimization agency, Image Freedom, spoke to our Full-Stack Bootcamp students during our weekly lunchtime talk series. Read on for six SEO takeaways from his presentation.The title tag, or the text written on the tab of your website, is a huge factor in your SEO ranking and should be as simple and straightforward as possible. The title tag is not the place for creative metaphors or puns: if your website is about finding cheap flights, the word “cheap flights” should most definitely be in your title tag.Likewise, the keywords you choose to emphasize on your website–especially the keywords within the first block of content on the homepage–should convey your purpose as concisely and simply as possible.Borrowing from the wisdom of Parks and Rec’s Ron Swanson, this quote means you should avoid spreading the same keywords across multiple pages on your site. Decide early on which keywords you want on each page and stick to it. If you need to reuse a keyword on a separate page, you can always put it in an image (which Google can’t read) or link it back to the original page where the keyword is emphasized.Never use the words, “click here” on your website to direct users to links or documents. “Click here” has been used so frequently to link to Adobe PDFs that, when you Google it, Adobe Reader is the first or second item listed. Using “click here” can actually hurt your SEO. Instead, use a link title that describes the content to which it’s linking.Example:= WRONG!= RIGHT!Shareable content, like a free brochure or infographic, can increase the amount of people linking to your site. When it comes to SEO, quality links are golden. You want as many quality links as you can get!Google is changing their algorithm (again) to factor in a site’s mobile-friendliness. This change is set to be released during the week of April 21st, 2015. If you want to maximize your SEO (and minimize mobile users’ frustration when browsing your site), you must ensure that your website uses responsive design. Not sure if your site is responsive?

https://codeup.com/web-development/journey-into-web-development/,Alumni Share their Journey into Web Development - Codeup,"Jul 7, 2020 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentEveryone starts somewhere. Many developers out there didn’t grow up wanting to code. It’s something they fell into over time, much like two Codeup alumni, Bridget Mills and Eddy Bautista. These two software developers graduated from our Web Development class in December 2019. They came back for a virtual panel event to share their journey into web development and to give advice to people wanting to become a software developer. Eddy had been a sales assistant for years and was a student at San Antonio College studying Kinesiology.Bridget worked at a courthouse, but those career plans were altered after becoming a military spouse and moving. She went back to school for a degree in Information Technology (IT), specializing in System Engineering, and became an IT Specialist. When someone he knew mentioned coding, Eddy learned all he could and coded for three days using online courses and tutorials. He immediately knew this was what he wanted to do as a career. While Bridget was working at the lawyer’s office, a development team came in to help with court systems. She asked them questions and became fascinated by what they were doing. After deciding not to pursue law, she decided to go back to school for IT. Her job as an IT Specialist isn’t exactly what she had in mind, but her degree didn’t offer the coding experience necessary to become a developer, which was her true end goal. Even after moving to Hawaii and having two kids, that dream persisted. Her cousin, a developer, mentioned that some of her coworkers went to a coding bootcamp. With another kid and another move on the horizon, she decided she would enroll in a coding bootcamp when her family settled down in Texas.  While researching how to become a developer, Eddy found Codeup. Our culture stood out to him, the admissions team was helpful, he liked that we offer help with the job search through resume assistance and interview training, and he really liked how plugged in we are to the San Antonio technology scene. He felt all the pieces coming together and could picture himself here.For Bridget, it boiled down to the curriculum and hands-on experience. When she was in college, she learned a lot of theory, but didn’t get experience actually coding, which, as she learned the hard way, is what employers are really looking for. She looked into some options for coding bootcamps and Codeup stood out to her. It was big plus that even as a military spouse, she was able to use VA benefits. She loved our assistance with job placement, and noted that she had gone to school twice and neither college offered anything like that.  Currently, both panelists are working as developers for VIA Metropolitan Transit. Due to COVID-19, they’re both working from home.Eddy usually starts his day early with a coding challenge on a website like Codewars. He has a virtual meeting with his mentor to discuss some code. For most of the day, they solve a problem or do some pair programming. They also have team meetings and daily standups.Bridget is currently leading an Artificial Intelligence project with VIA that takes up most of her time. She usually has virtual meetings with members of her team, other teams at VIA, and contractors. She does documentation and uses programs to update the current status of her projects for the team to see.  Coding is a hobby for Bridget. She takes her laptop with her from room to room, sometimes coding with her child in her lap. She loves it so much, she often works late unintentionally until her kids come in the room to check on her. Because of this, she doesn’t feel completely balanced but knows that it’s only because she loves it so much.Eddy feels similarly, stating that when they do work late, it’s usually because they want to. The work-life balance has been good for him. Bridget was nervous coming into Codeup, but it gave her everything she was looking for. Part of why she wanted to begin her journey into web development was because she thought developers get to sit around alone, not having to interact with anybody. She very quickly realized this was not the case. “You have to speak up and you have to do it well, and often, with a lot of people. You’ll have to work hard, beyond the regular hours. Take advantage of all the resources. Schedule some meetups with peers to work together outside of class. It’s so worth it in the end. Just go for it!”Eddy learned that keeping a part-time job is possible but really, really hard. He was one of the only students ever to finish Codeup while working a job, rushing to work right after class. He regrets doing that because he missed out on socializing and working together after hours. But when he had time, he always tried to work with other students to solve problems together, and encourages the same in others. “Break out of your comfort zone and don’t be scared to just start from where you are. The first couple weeks will be really hard, but learn to fall in love with the feeling of being stuck, because eventually you’ll be able to solve it.”Bridget and Eddy are working together at VIA, but took very different pathways to get to where they are. Eddy hadn’t thought much about coding before deciding to dive right into it, whereas Bridget wanted a career as a developer for years. Whether coding is something you never gave much thought to or you’ve tried a different route before, you, too, can make a transition into web development with Codeup!

https://codeup.com/web-development/coding-resolutions-for-the-new-year/,Coding Resolutions for the New Year - Codeup,"Jan 9, 2019 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentBy Joyce LingFor many people, January is a time for new beginnings. People commit to losing weight, learning new things, establishing new budgets – it’s a time of action and hope. In this article, I’d like to share a few ways that have helped me improve my coding and might give you some ideas to implement for 2019!“Good seasons start with good beginnings.” – Sparky AndersonAlthough the process of learning coding is a marathon and not a sprint, there’s something to be said for short bursts of productivity like a 30-day challenge. For one, it may be an effective way to just get started on something you have been meaning to do for awhile, and as Mark Twain noted, “Half of getting ahead is getting started.”On top of that, it gets rid of any excuses about “not having enough time”. Because it’s a short sprint, most people will begin prioritizing it differently. As different items on your daily to-do list begin to demand your time, you begin to prioritize the things that matter. Especially if you are a goal-oriented person, the satisfaction of completing a challenge like this may force you to prioritize it over other things. This may be the impetus you need to create lasting habits, ideally even after the challenge is over. However, over-enthusiastic participants may have to be wary of burnout or of a short-term “high”. Make sure to use that momentum and keep on keeping on!If you Google “coding 30-day challenge”, a multitude of options pop up. These challenges hypothetically can be done at any time, but doing it in January can be a powerful experience as you make a commitment to investing in yourself in 2019. Some popular coding challenges include the #Javascript30 by developer Wes Bos, the 30 day challenge at TechGig, and the 30 Days of Code by HackerRank. The first challenge is specific to Javascript, but the latter two challenges allow you to choose from a variety of languages to complete the challenges, so choose your best language and get coding!“Success isn’t always about greatness. It’s about consistency. Consistent hard work leads to success. Greatness will come. – Dwayne JohnsonFor those of you that are over the 30-day challenge hype, simply commit to coding every single day of 2019. If you’re like me and have a bunch of grandiose life goals for yourself such as “Speak French fluently” and “Be able to program any full stack application”, you may also have to be reminded that these grandiose goals can only be reached by consistently chipping away at it on a daily basis. It requires you to embrace mundanity and discipline.A neat life hack for making this goal a reality is finding a habit tracker such as HabitBull or Habitica. Both of these apps allow you to customize habits that you would like to form and track how often you complete those habits. Habitbull generates statistics and graphs for the frequency of completing certain habits, while Habitica promises to “gamify your life”. Although this option may no longer be available for purchase, take a look at Simone Giertz’s Kickstarter for a 365 calendar here. This is a visual example of what completing a full year’s worth of coding can look like.If you dedicate yourself to coding every single day, you may be surprised at how much progress you’ve made by the end of the year. Even extremely successful individuals such as Josh Bosquez, the Senior Vice President of Engineering at my company, Armor, has shared that he still commits to coding every single day even if it’s only one line. No matter what your coding experience level is, making it a priority to code every single day can only benefit your growth as a programmer. No matter what, you’ve got to always follow your passion in life and always keep learning. – Harold HammTechnology is developing rapidly, and developers are constantly enhancing and creating frameworks and programming languages. For example, if you’re even slightly involved in the coding community, you would probably know that for front-end frameworks, React and Vue have recently exploded in popularity. In order to stay relevant and continue to develop marketable skills, make an effort to stay up to date about news and trends in the programming world and keeping your skills sharp. If you’re just starting out with programming and feel that you have reached a plateau, many more experienced developers will recommend learning a second programming language to reiterate what you know and simultaneously enhance your understanding of programming on a deeper level.However, learning a new technology includes more than just learning a new programming language or framework. Explore what’s interesting to you. Have you always wanted to look into artificial intelligence and machine learning? Or are you interested in the cloud and learning AWS? Or maybe you’ve always wanted to learn more about developing mobile applications. Commit to an actionable goal by either taking a course for a specific technology you want to learn or by studying and passing a certification. If you work for a company, it may be worth it to see if your manager agrees to help pay for additional learning or certifications. The best way to learn is by doing. The only way to build a strong work ethic is getting your hands dirty. – Alex SpanosIf you’ve decided you want to learn a new technology, the above quote by Alex Spanos is the perfect way to gain that proficiency. This can be done on your own or with a group of friends for accountability. One specific resource I always like to recommend is Chingu. This international group of developers goes through “Voyages”, a process which encompasses project planning, developing, testing, and launching an application, specifically with the end goal of learning or practicing a new technology. Many of the participants are full-time software developers, but the collection of individuals is usually diverse. This organization is mostly focused on front-end technologies but they also have data science/design tracks in development. Check out their website for examples of previous projects teams have built and details on how to apply. You’re never too young or too old to be a mentor. – Reshma SaujaniEven if you are just starting out, there are usually local organizations that need volunteers to mentor/facilitate learning for youth. In San Antonio I was hired part-time by Youth Code Jam, a non-profit that organizes and plans pop-up events and hosts summer camps in order to educate youth in topics related to technology. Currently, in Dallas, I volunteer with Bold Idea, a local organization that teaches kids to code, as well as facilitate a Girls Who Code group at a local library. Although I don’t consider myself yet to be a very experienced developer, seeking these leadership roles is more than just a resume builder. Because I have participated in these opportunities, I’ve been able to expose myself to a wider variety of technologies such as block-level coding in Scratch, or creating Minecraft mods in Python. Additionally, it’s a great way to network and meet people who are also interested in or work in the the technology field. Most large cities have similar local nonprofits or a chapter of a national organization such as Girls Who Code. If none exist, start one! Every successful individual knows that his or her achievement depends on a community of persons working together. – Paul RyanAlthough flying solo works for some, I have always found that having a tight knit community of motivated developers to consistently code with has always helped me grow. When I was participating in Codeup, some of us would form study groups or code together on projects after class at the local co-working space, Geekdom. Although the community that is available at a bootcamp is not available to everyone, I would recommend searching Meetup.com for technology networking groups or programming specific get-togethers. Alternatively, make sure to check for a local chapter of FreeCodeCamp in your city. Other places to look include maker spaces and co-working spaces, both of which are communities that developers are typically drawn towards. If both of those options come up empty, then start a group! Create a space for people to get together and work on their projects – invariably, you will draw like-minded people towards you.[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

Want to advance your current career by adding “coding” to your resume?Codeup’s Night Bootcamp might be the answer for you! Starting in March, we’re launching an “after hours” option for aspiring professional computer programmers who want to attend a Codeup bootcamp, but can’t commit to a full-time schedule during the day. Night Bootcamp’s course content mirrors that of Day Bootcamp, but classes run on weekday evenings and alternating weekends.Just like Day Bootcamp, classes are in person, with live instructors leading you through a project-based curriculum in a collaborative learning environment.  It’s the same Codeup “special sauce,” just on a different timeline.You can see our results for yourself on our Alumni page. From our November cohort, 11 out of the 12 are working and the 12th is a Codeup Fellow. We’ve created over $2.5 million dollars in new tech salaries. Intensity + focus + solid staff + positive environment = great output.Night Bootcamp lasts nine months, beginning March 20th and ending December 18th. The course includes over 650 hours of classroom instruction, with additional instructor-manned study halls for students who need extra time.If Night Bootcamp is the learning opportunity you’ve been waiting for, apply now or check out the Night Bootcamp page for more details.__________________________________________________________UPDATE: We no longer offer part-time classes. This modality of learning proved extremely unsuccessful with alarmingly low completion rates. In our experience, if you’re fully committed to changing your life and work toward it full-time, it will happen. If you are only partly committed and work toward it part-time, you’ll fall back into old patterns.  Ultimately, our mission of “empowering life change” did not align with part-time classes. Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/what-makes-a-successful-software-developer/,What Makes a Successful Software Developer? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development Written by Dimitri AntoniouSoftware developers build the programs, games, and apps that run on your computer, cell-phone, tablet, video-game system or e-reader. A software developer can be front-end, back-end or full stack.Successful software developers come from diverse backgrounds and a variety of industries. Here at Codeup, our job is to advance existing careers and launch new ones. That means we’ve seen it all. We’ve learned that being a successful software developer comes from the right combination of personality traits and technical knowledge. We’ve gathered a few questions to ask yourself if you are considering becoming a software developer.You will spend your time building, improving and maintaining different types of software across different pieces of technology. This means that working with computers, phones &amp; tablets should be something you enjoy. This might sound obvious, but it’s huge! We often meet students who are attracted to tech because of exciting new products, collaborative work environments, and flexible schedules. These are all awesome perks, but remember that the most important piece of your work will be the code itself. A software developer spends the majority of their time fixing problems and building frameworks.Technology is a constantly evolving industry. While one language is hot today, it might die tomorrow. Our co-founder, Jason Straughan, often reminisces about writing an entire book on a language that disappeared from use by the time the book was published. What does that mean for you? You should love the process of learning new skills and keeping up to date with cutting-edge technologies. A career in technology gives you the opportunity to reinvent yourself many times. You may love working with databases today and find that UI/UX is where your strengths are in a year. You will need to be able to adapt to changes in the industry and be willing to learn on the job or put in the hours on your own time. The more programming languages under your belt the more value you will be able to provide during every stage of your career.Grit is a character trait that can make or break long-term success. Psychologist Angela Duckworth explains it as, “Passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina…sticking with your future, day in and day out.” When it comes to software development, having grit means learning from your failures. We’ve seen students struggle not because they can’t figure out the content, but because they are afraid of failing. Move past that fear! You will inevitably make mistakes, but our successful students are those that learn from their failure along the way.At the end of the day, code is designed to solve a problem! Your ability to think logically, brainstorm creative solutions, proactively research answers, and fill gaps will make you an effective and efficient software developer. That’s why we test for problem-solving ability in our admissions process. Do you like tinkering, Googling, fixing, solving puzzles, and finding your own answers? If you do, you may appreciate the challenges that come along with developing software and debugging code.These are the questions to ask yourself when making the decision to become a software developer. If you answered yes to these questions, coding could be for you. At Codeup we offer an 18-week career accelerator that will help you get a foot in the industry. Ready to start?

https://codeup.com/web-development/using-git-as-a-communication-tool/,Using Git as a Communication Tool - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective StudentsAs Josh Freeman of Grok Interactive shared with our students during a lunchtime talk, it’s extremely important to maintain quality communication when working on a project.Git, while primarily a tool for version control, can be used to facilitate this kind of interaction. Freeman recommends two simple steps to maximize communication in Git.1. Use the Git commit as an opportunity to increase communication by explaining the changes you make to your code, as opposed to explaining it in a comment.Set up a Git commit template, or a standardized layout for commit messages. Freeman’s template is listed below. Don’t forget, your commit message summary must be 50 characters or less; all other lines should be under 72 characters.(Configuring your Git commit template)Example Git Commit Template:2. Organize your commits logically.Sections of code that don’t relate to each other shouldn’t be committed together. Instead, break your code into logical sections and commit each section separately.You can accomplish this by adding to the index in patches, which allows you to stage parts of files and provides finer control over what you commit. Maintaining an organization to your commits will make it much easier to communicate via the commit template.(Adding to the index in patches)Following these two simple Git guidelines can prevent frustration that arises when deciphering code. Communication is key not only for your current team members, but also for your future self or future developers who may inherit your code sometime down the line.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/dont-be-scared-of-coding/,Don't Be Scared of Coding - Codeup,"Oct 29, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development When you’re scared to run your code, and it works the first try (Halloween style)!When I first started as a developer I ran into some scary scenarios. My code was very error prone and I created some functions that I was expecting a string as the output but I got an object. It was very frustrating and I wasn’t even sure I would be able to understand software development let alone have to go and fix my code. My nightmare scenario was to be hired on as a developer and then have to troubleshoot, a.k.a. debug, some other developers code😱😱😱. I think most junior developers have had shared my fear at some point in their career. I was taught to heavily rely upon outputting your results to the console whether its good or bad to help troubleshoot.In this post I will do my best to help calm the fears of my fellow junior developers with helpful debugging tools and hopefully transition away from relying upon console.log(). While my focus will be on JavaScript these tools can easily be translated to other languages.For the longest time console.log() was my go-to when I needed to debug JavaScript code. It was my developer friend who told me what was wrong with my code and was never judgemental . I will admit that there are few scenarios where it is “OK” to output the results of a function to the console.Except more recently, I have found using console.log() to be less useful when debugging and only making things worse by expecting a good outcome and then disappointing me. Like an expired $5 Amazon Gift Card (Thanks, grandma). Take for example, this gem:That lovely error is from IE 11 which does not support Array.from(node List) prototype without a shim/poly fill that is available here.However, I have come to find out that logging errors to the console is either inefficient or completely irrelevant to what may actually be causing the problem in your code. I will admit that some errors are easily resolved by reading the output of the error message and fixing the typo or following the instructions of the error message to help resolve the problem.So in the image above we are shown a node item which has so many properties that you might not be aware of, which renders console.log useless. You have to know ahead of time what value or specific attribute you are trying to output which requires some abstract thinking or referencing documentation to identify this property. Now using the console.log will output all the entire properties of the node item but its an unnecessary step to add in this line of code while you debug and then go back and remove the line of code.“You don’t know what you don’t know” -Bill Parcel (Head Coach New England Patriots)The error the console outputs might provide you with the location of the error, but you may not know why are you getting the error in the first place. Maybe you’re passing the incorrect value to the function or you are working with event handling and bubbling events.Either way, chances are that you aren’t thinking about that one property that is actually passing the value your expecting because you weren’t aware of how to call it or pass it along.I’m going to piggy back off of Mozilla’s Debug Playground as an example for why you shouldn’t use the console and instead use the Browsers built-in debugger or equally as helpful is an IDE’s built-in debugger.cough cough Visual Studio Code cough cough Now, whether you prefer Chrome over FireFox is a whole different can-o-worms.“Hey man, I’m a back-end developer and so I need to console.log”-Fictional Backend DeveloperSo maybe you don’t have a fully fleshed out web form or you’re trying to get data from some API or JSON file. You need to see data from the function you’re writing or better yet you want to test a function that someone else wrote without having to clone the entire project. Using console.log() seems like the go to. In fact, around ¾ of Node.js developers report using it (in 2017) for finding errors in their applications.I’m here to tell you of a few better ways to debug your code.The first tool I have come to love and trust is one made by a company called Wallaby.jsQuokkaJS (Integrated Scratchpad for JavaScript)With this plug-in you can write your code and get immediate results. No need to throw in a bunch of console.log’s in your function and check the output. It has an integration for VSCode (💖💖💖 ), JetBrainsIDE and Atom. I personally have purchased a pro license but for the most part the community version will work just fine.SonarLint ( Like spellcheck but for your code)I think all developers should have some sort of code linting tool added into their IDE. This helps review your code in real-time and “should” prevent you from compiling or running code with errors in it. I’ve chosen SonarLint because its given me better results than ES6 linter or some other linting tools that i’ve tried. I’m not saying its the best or that the others don’t work but I haven’t had to configure much other than just installing the extension.Scratchpad (Built-in Browser Javascript sandbox)Mozilla also offers a feature in their DevTools that allows you to write, run, and view the output of JavaScript code that can interact with the current web page or not.I have a background in .NET development and I have fallen in love with Microsoft’s F# Language along with the fsharp community. While going through the documentation I was introduced to a new term, REPL.REPL stands for: Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop.“ In a REPL, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results.” -WikipediaSo I thought, this was cool and I used my Googliness™️ to search for an online version or service and so I came upon THIS.REPL.ITI don’t need to console.log my output or assign the function to var result = greeting() and then console.log(greeting(""Jessica"")) . I just write my function, invoke it and BOOM! I get the output without the need of console.log() .Repl.it supports many languages!I can even create a Repl, write some code and share the link with someone that can give me feedback, Brilliant!Coincidentally, Repl.it uses Monaco, which is the same Editor that VSCode uses.Finally, for the developer on a budget (including myself) most popular IDEs have a built-in debugger that works the same was as the debugger in Chrome or Firefox.I’ve kindly added links to How-Tos: For a few IDEs (don’t get mad if your IDE is not listed, I’m looking at you Atom IDE community).Debugging in VSCode Debugging in JetBrains IntelliJDebugging in Visual StudioFinal ThoughtsSo why have I gone through the long winded trouble of explaining / trying to convince you why you should wean yourself off of using the console.log and embrace debugging tools? How was this suppose to make you feel better / more confident in writing code?The short answer is: I believe having more information and proper tools “should” make coding, and for that matter debugging, less daunting / scary.Use of widely available, open-source debugging tools is key to be more familiar with software development and to grow as a developer.[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/where-to-learn-to-code-in-san-antonio/,Where to Learn to Code in San Antonio - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentWithout any background knowledge it’s easy to end up in the wrong level of instruction, learning the wrong code, at the wrong time. Whether it’s a full-fledged degree or a 3-month bootcamp, there’s an array of opportunities for aspiring programmers in San Antonio.The most traditional route to a programming education is enrolling in a university or community college. Almost all of the major universities in San Antonio, including The University of Texas at San Antonio, Trinity University, and Texas A&amp;M San Antonio offer a degree in computer science. The Alamo Colleges also has associates degrees in computer science and certificates in related subjects like C++ , Linux, SQL and Java. Attending a university is expensive; tuition at these schools usually runs from about $10,000 to $60,000 a year, which can quickly add up to an unmanageable amount after four years. Two years of core curriculum filled with history, math, and science is also required before students start learning how to code. Sometimes an employer will require a degree before they look at programming skills, so this path is advantageous to those who need that piece of paper.There are programs in San Antonio teaching necessary programming skills that are less expensive and less time consuming than the traditional university route. Local tech giant Rackspace Hosting started Open Cloud Academy to give San Antonians a hands-on learning experience. Learning tracks include Linux Sys Admin and Network Operations. They have plans to add Software Development in the future. The courses are usually six to eight weeks long and cost around $4,000. Codeup is another great way to learn programming with a focus on Web Development. In twelve-weeks students go from non-techie to talented web programmer for between $9,875 to $13,900. Both programs offer special incentives for the ladies who want to learn how to code. There’s a huge lack of diversity in the tech industry and they’re looking to close the gap. Codeup offers 50% off tuition for several ladies each cohort and Open Cloud Academy gives out 20 scholarships for women participating in Linux for Ladies.Free less extensive classes are also available for teens and vets. Codeup Teens lets high school students get a taste of what being a programmer is all about, without having to pay a cent. The same opportunities are offered for veterans and active duty military through Codeup Vets. Younger kids can try out Made With Code for a basic and fun introduction to coding. Other single-day events include the very popular SA Code Jam for kids of all ages and the School’s Out Hackathon run by actual high school students for high schoolers.San Antonio has a vibrant up-and-coming tech scene with lots of opportunities to get involved. Universities deliver a structured learning environment and degrees many employers are looking for. Bootcamps are perfect for those who want to learn quickly and start working.

https://codeup.com/web-development/debugging-with-codey-the-rubber-duck/,Debugging with Codey the Rubber Duck - Codeup,"Oct 10, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentBy Jennifer WalkerI first encountered rubber duck debugging while attending Codeup. Each student had a duck at their seat on the first day of our 18 ½ week advanced full stack web development boot camp. The expression of each duck varied, but they all stared quietly and blankly at us as we took in our surroundings with excitement and anticipation. At the time, I had no idea what it was for or why we needed that bath time friend. Now I do.Part of what I love about programming is the problem-solving. However, in the attempt to figure out a software solution the developer very often can get tunnel vision – stuck on solving a problem the same wrong way or just get stumped with no real direction. This is where rubber duck debugging is the most useful. It originated from a book called “The Pragmatic Programmer” by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas.Rubber duck debugging is simple. It includes taking the problem you are trying to solve and explaining it out loud to the rubber duck. This may seem silly because most of us have not talked to inanimate objects since we were kids. However, by doing this it forces a developer to think in a different way and to look at an issue under a microscope. Talking out loud activates a different part of the human brain, which very often helps the developer solve a problem without ever talking to another person. It keeps us from wasting our own time and the time of others when the solution is right at our fingertips.I have experienced this phenomenon myself when I try to explain aspects of programming to people who are not programmers. It forces me to think of programming in a different way. I have to lose the acronyms, and just speak plain English to a person who isn’t such an avid techie like myself. When I do that I walk away with new knowledge and a refreshed passion for what I have been discussing.I also learned later that the rubber duck is the official mascot for Codeup. His name is Codey and he has a special meaning to me beyond just rubber duck debugging. I began to sketch him on the first day of class. Over time he began to express my struggles and triumphs while learning to code. He came alive for me and became a student of Codeup alongside me during my time there. If I had a bad day, he totally understood because he was in the fire with me. If I struggled to understand a concept, he got that too and listened while I talked to him about what I was trying to do. Now, as a proud graduate of Codeup working as a software developer at a fantastic company, I keep Codey with me. He is in my car and at my desk at work. He also sits on my desk at home – waiting patiently to hear my struggles and what I am trying to solve for that day.If you do not have a rubber duck for debugging, I suggest you go out and get one!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/best-path-to-software-development-is-not-a-four-year-degree/,The Best Path To A Career In Software Development - Codeup,"Jan 28, 2020 | Full Stack Web Development“Don’t I need a Computer Science degree to get a job as a software developer?” As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. Prospective students often compare us to four year degrees in CS with the concern that lacking a piece of paper and formal degree will prevent them from getting a job. We’re here to tell you once and for all: college is NOT the best way to become a software developer.For the avoidance of doubt, there is a lot of merit to a four year degree, as well as a lot of valuable knowledge from a CS program that can apply to life as a developer. However, if your goal is to get a job as a software developer, there’s a more direct path.Think of it this way:my plumbing is old and broken, and I need to replace it all. I hire a PhD in Fluid Dynamics – someone who really understands flow, gravity, resistance, momentum, and all the intricacies of what’s happening in my pipes. They come and explain how everything is supposed to work in my new pipes, charge me $5,000 for their time, and then leave. With my pipes still broken, I decided to hire a plumber – someone who knows how to identify the problem and fix it,and a week later my plumbing is fully functional and I’ve only spent $2,500. [Note, we kind of made these numbers up to illustrate a point. After all, we’re no drain surgeons.]The message here is simple: theory is not the same thing as practical experience. With the rapid growth in web and IT, we’re no longer just dealing with cutting-edge technologies. Development is becoming the new blue-collar factory work, and the amount of code out there is astounding. It’s no longer as important to have high-level abstract education. Instead, the top priority is up-to-date practical experience.Now, let’s get more specific. Why exactly is a coding bootcamp the better way to get a job as a software developer?#1 Technologies: Technology changes at the speed of light. One day the popular framework is Angular, and the next it’s React. In one generation, companies are building with C++ and in the next they’re building with Java. Because of this rate of change, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. While they continue to teach C++, we’ve moved on to Java with a Spring framework and MySQL database. Because we’re more agile, we are able to keep pace with industry trends.#2 Curriculum structure: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduce amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. This career is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.#3 Job placement services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most undergraduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education. #4 Programming hours: This is similar to number 2, but so important that it’s worth repeating. The single most important thing a would-be developer can do is spend time writing code. Practice, practice, practice is the lesson above all else. You need to engage with the problem-solving cycle, learn how to fail, and learn to overcome the barriers inherent in programming. It’s a lot like learning an instrument. When you start out, you struggle to play single notes. You then practice scales and exercises, and before long you’re playing songs, thinking about the intonation and sound over playing the notes. With programming, you need to spend hours to get the basics under your fingers in order to graduate to complex problem-solving and application development. At Codeup, you spend 670 hours in hands-on, instructor-led classroom time. For those of you who like math, that’s roughly equivalent to the number of hours in a four-year degree. It just happens in 6 months, and those hours are hands-on.If you’re still not convinced, consider the story of Po. Po graduated from Trinity University with a 4 year degree in Computer Science. He graduated with a good GPA, but couldn’t find work as a web developer for a whole year. Companies told him he didn’t have enough full-stack experience, a big enough portfolio, and was lacking modern technologies and languages. So, he came to Codeup. He paired his theory knowledge with our practical knowledge and landed a job immediately upon graduation. Since then, he’s moved to Dallas to join Cognizant, where he’s been able to double his salary and move into a new position as a lead developer.

https://codeup.com/web-development/alumni-spotlight-stefanie-young-and-lorne-barfield/,Alumni Spotlight: Stefanie Young and Lorne Barfield - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development Stefanie Young and Lorne Barfield are both Codeup grads and the co-founders of Innov8 Place, a website development company. Here, they share their highs, their lows, their experience and their best tips for succeeding during and after the program.Stefanie: I’m originally from California. I grew up in the Silicon Valley before the days of Google and had a pretty decent handle on free internet via AOL Trial discs, Napster torrenting, and multi-player gaming platforms (before they were cool). Given the mid to late 90’s, I had quite a bit of backlash within the online communities for my gender and my age. I gave up on tech during my early college years when a female professor told me, “there no room for women in the booming tech industry.” I quickly turned to music and language arts and found myself pursuing the long-term degree before leaving for Texas to enter a Japanese Studies program. I had a rude awakening and poor experience when most jobs I was offered were non-technical, non-creative, and extremely repetitive. It wasn’t going to work. My grandfather had always been a firm believer that I was meant for tech, engineering and developing new ideas. After chatting with him about my failed attempts and unhappiness, I decided to give tech another try through coding and entered into the Codeup family. I worked full-time while attending a night class and found myself doubting my abilities from the beginning. During our first project, something clicked and with the help of the instructors, I had a new-found love for problem solving, developing and code. I haven’t turned back since.Lorne: I’m also from California.  I hail from Oakland.  I’m into just about everything.  I have worked as a high school basketball coach, personal chef, bartender, bouncer, opera singer, paralegal/legal assistant, and dance instructor.  I love movies and books….I read about 40+ a year.  I’m into fantasy and sci-fi, but also enjoy reading Deepak Chopra and books about travelogues (which is somewhat funny because I’m terrified of traveling). I’m a hippie, jock, musician, and nerd. I love people and connection and for someone who grew up largely an only child, I’m always out creating new family.  If something interests me, I pursue it.  I like to dive into things that I can share with others.  I’m an avid NBA fan (Go Warriors!) and if you ever want to argue about basketball, I’m game.  If you want to see me fully free and in my element, put me around music and dancing. Programming puts me back in my Lego days, where I get to be creative and build things. It’s my new adventure. Stefanie: I wasn’t always interested in programming. I had always seen programming as a career that leads to a dark room with smelly individuals, Cheetos and Mountain Dew. I didn’t want to be placed in a cubical and made to work 10 – 16 hour days to complete a project or operating system. Web development when I first set out to learn tech was not a major degree option or talked about much. Browsers were faulty and new to the scene. It was a questionable career path at the time. My grandfather was an engineer with Stanford University and always brought home hardware for PCs. I thought that would be my path as well. I loved building and problem solving the communication errors between parts. Little did I know that programming was that too on a more abstract and dynamic level.Lorne: I absolutely thought programming was way out of my range and my experience.  Nothing about it felt like something I would be into.  I had simply grown out of my old position and location.  I was a paralegal in San Francisco and I was no longer challenged.  I wanted to go back to school or do something new but had no clue what.  It was too expensive to do there, my parents brought up Codeup (they live here), and here I am. Stefanie: Honestly, I was extremely doubtful of the program, especially after being trained into the thought process that traditional college was the only form of useful education and the only experience one should seek before career searching. It wasn’t until I was trying to break into marketing firms, coding communities and design groups that I was told about the program. Three people approached me and recommended the program. I didn’t listen. Then life started shouting it at me. I saw the billboard… then a marketing card in the mail… and then I heard a friend talking about their acceptance into the program. Finally I gave in and went to the Codeup location.I took a couple of tests and passed with flying colors. I decided to take the leap since they were offering a night program that started after work hours. Since they helped with job placement as well, I took them to be my chance at a better work life.Lorne: I was on the verge of going to teach English in Turkey when my parents suggested that I look at Codeup.  I took the test, not sure if I’d get in, and then when I did, I bought a ticket the next day and the rest is history. Stefanie: Overall, my experience was eye-opening. I did not expect to have young mothers, grandmothers, high school graduates or college graduates with Masters in the same class. The culture was liberating since we were all there for the same reason – to change our paths and achieve new goals. The instructors were very hands on and helped everyone thinking about problem-solving in new ways and how to attempt developing ideas out of nothing. The hardest step was always deciding where to start and finding the confidence to dive in, code first, and prepare to work through your own problems and use the resources available. Lorne: Codeup opened my eyes to a new world.  They made programming and something that seemed so daunting, really fun.  I never thought I would enjoy it, but the collaborative nature of it and the creative juices that got to come out, made me fall in love with it.  The instructors, the classroom, everything about it made me feel like I could do it.  I think that was the largest thing.  Despite any difficulties or frustrating, I felt empowered…like given time and community, I could solve anything.  That’s an awesome feeling. Stefanie: The program taught me independence and confidence. I am more free-thinking than I have ever been. I understand how to think about everyday issues from multiple viewpoints, and I know how to stand my ground and prove my points and way of thinking. I know that it’s okay to be wrong and how to go about admitting it. Even if it seems counterproductive to building independence, I know it’s okay to ask for help.The program also taught me about resourcefulness and communication on a whole new level. These two features alone were enough to land me just about any job. Soft skills are just as important as the hard skills. Lorne: It taught me how to break down problems.  It taught me how to ask for help and that is perfectly right and ok. Codeup gave me my first job, and kind of my second, as I worked for one of the founders as my second.  They always believe in their students and help them match and grow. Stefanie: Understand that this program is meant to accelerate your learning of development. You have to be hungry for this knowledge and supplement the curriculum outside of the classroom as well as practicing it. There has to be a drive for the goal ahead. Be willing to sacrifice some of your free time.This class is so much more rewarding if you learn to work as a class unit early on and help each other succeed. Employers will see it in your example work, the projects and want to hear about your ability to communicate and mesh well as a developer. Be open-minded and be willing to be wrong. I learned so much more from being wrong than from being right. Experience is priceless in the long run. Lorne: Stay patient and humble.  This world of programming is huge.  It can be overwhelming.  Just keep that learner mind and understand that time and keyboard time are your greatest assets.   It may not feel like you’re growing, but then you’ll look up every now and then and realize just how much you know and how far you’ve come.  It’s a pretty awesome feeling. Stefanie: The staff and fellow classmates made the program great in my eyes. The interactions and experiences of having a new community of people who had similar goals made for a welcoming and productive environment.Lorne: I think the greatest part is the classroom.  The idea that when everyone shares knowledge, everyone succeeds.  The collaborative power of coding is insane and if there’s anything I can attribute to the rapid rise of technology is that it brought a collective human mind to any problem.  People from all over the world now have the ability to work together to create brand new things.  You get your first taste of that in the classroom.  The sense that everyone wants you to succeed and you can lean on one another to fill in gaps where you may not be the strongest.  It’s a really amazing feeling.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/programming-like-a-girl/,"Programming ""Like a Girl"" - Codeup","Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective StudentsThe Six Female ENIAC ProgrammersBetween 1943 and 1945, six women programmed the ENIAC–one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers in the world–as part of a U.S. Army project. Without the luxury of programming textbooks or tools, Kathleen McNulty, Betty Snyder Holberton, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Jean Jennings Bartik, Ruth Lichterman, and Frances Bila Spence programmed an 80 foot-long by 8 foot-tall machine with over 3,000 switches to run a ballistics trajectory in just seconds. Although these women receive credit for this feat nowadays, their names weren’t even mentioned when the machine was revealed in 1946.Grace Murray HopperEver wonder where the term “debugging” comes from? Rumor has it this colloquialism traces back to Hopper, who literally had to extract a moth from inside a computer while troubleshooting. Dubbed “The Queen of Software,” Hopper graduated from Vassar College in 1928 with a B.A. in mathematics and physics and later joined the Navy Reserve during the war. She was the first woman to obtain a PhD in Mathematics from Yale and the first female to reach admiral rank in the Navy, where she worked on the first programmable computer in the U.S., the Mark I. Hopper also developed COBOL (common business-oriented language), one of the first modern programming languages. That’s a lot of firsts!Ada LovelaceThe daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Lovelace’s mother steered her away from her father’s literary tendencies and toward mathematics. Lovelace met English mathematician and engineer, Charles Babbage, at a party in 1833, where he told her about early plans for his Babbage Engine. Later on in 1843, Lovelace translated an article on the engine into French, adding her own notes about using a series of operations with the computer to solve a mathematical problem. Although the engine was never successfully built, Lovelace’s writing is considered the first published description of such a process; because of this, she is sometimes called the “first programmer.”Radia PerlmanThe world knows Perlman as “The Mother of the Internet,” but she resents the title, arguing that no single person can be responsible for this impressive accomplishment. Perlman developed the Spanning Tree Protocol, which allows loop-free topology for bridged Ethernet areas. Perlman has a B.S. and M.S. in mathematics and a PhD in Computer Science, all from MIT. She holds over 100 patents and has won multiple awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award from Usenix.Karen Spärck JonesJones, a British computer scientist, is credited with inventing IDF in 1972. IDF, or “inverse document frequency,” is the statistical method behind weighting terms in search engines, which helps rank their importance when a user enters a query. Variations of IDF are used in modern search engines to rank a web page’s relevance to a user’s search. Without Jones’ contribution, navigating the internet would be pretty chaotic.Codeup’s Female GradsFinally, this blog post wouldn’t be complete without the mention of Codeup’s female graduates. We’d like to collectively commend the 28 female students who have completed or are currently completing our bootcamp. Although we’d love to list them all, we’ve limited it to a few shoutouts for sake of space:Codeup is passionate about narrowing the gender gap in programming.

https://codeup.com/web-development/exploring-new-domains-icanns-gtld-program/,Exploring New Domains: ICANN's gTLD Program - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective Students The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the global Domain Name System (DNS), is in the middle of rolling out its new gTLD program, which has the potential to reshape how users find information on the internet and how organizations build their identities online.Kevin Kopas, Channel Manager for Radix Registry, stopped by the Codeup classroom to help students better understand the gTLD program and how it may transform the domain industry over the next few years.Domains are identifiers that create spaces of authority within the internet. A domain reflects an Internet Protocol address (IP address), which links to the server where a website is hosted.  Domains are organized according to a hierarchical model consisting of top-level, second-level, and lower-level domains.Top-level domains (TLDs) constitute the highest level of domains in the DNS. There are many types of TLDs–including country codes like .us, .uk, and .jp–and Generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs), such as .com, .info, .edu, and .org. gTLDs are operated and managed by registries, like Radix.Second and lower-level domains directly follow TLDs and are located to the left of the “.” in a domain. For a visual, in the domain “codeup20.wpengine.com,”  “.com”  is the gTLD and “codeup” is the second-level domain. Typically, registries delegate the responsibility of allotting domain names to registrars, such as GoDaddy.Until recently, the list of gTLDs was limited to traditional strings, like the previously-mentioned .com and .net, as well as .gov, .mil, .org. and .edu. Over the years, the number of desirable and available second and third-level domains associated with these gTLDs has become increasingly scarce.To diversify the pool of available domains, ICANN is in the process of introducing 1300+ new gTLDs. These include everything from .baby, .mls, .dot,  and .realty, to .sucks, and .buy. Radix has acquired eight new gTLDs, including .space, and .website, and will soon be offering .tech.Registries can apply for a new gTLD through ICANN. In the case that multiple registries apply for the same gTLD, those companies partake in an auction to determine the winner. ICANN runs its own auction to solve these contention sets; however, companies have found ways to resolve these disputes before reaching ICANN through private auctions like Applicant Auction, which have their own rules and regulations. Sometimes companies even negotiate deals on their own instead of conducting a private auction.The winning price for each gTLD varies. Registries often play a high-stakes guessing game where big prices have the potential for big returns. For example, on the low end of the March 2015 ICANN auction  , .srl was purchased for $400,000; on the high end, Google purchased .app for $25 million.In Kopas’ opinion, slowly but surely, the .coms and .nets of the world will become overpowered by more specific gTLDs. While the impending end of the .com era may be sad for some, this shift also opens up new opportunity for creativity and specificity in a company’s branding and marketing.With a more diverse list of available gTLDS, companies can better align their web presences with their products or services: a beauty salon could use .salon or an independent realtor could use .realtor. On the flip side, users will be able to tailor their searches based on a company’s gTLD. This change also has the potential to offer credibility to businesses in certain industries. For example, in order to obtain a .law domain, the applicant must be a licensed practitioner.But will these new gTLDs ever really become the norm? Will Google’s $25 million investment in .app produce a sizable ROI? Only time will tell. In order for this shift to happen, consumers must understand the industry and recognize the new variety of available gTLDs. Thanks to Kopas, Codeup students are now “in the know” about the changing domain of domains!For more info on the upcoming gTLD changes, check out ICANN’s FAQ page.To hear about how applicants plan to use the new gTLDs, watch ICANN’s video series.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/alumni-spotlight-mary-kaitlin-mk-warren/,Alumni Spotlight: Mary-Kaitlin (MK) Warren - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentFrom being an Assistant Manager at Entreprise Rent-A-Car to becoming a stellar programmer, MK shares her path that led her to where she is now—a student in the Microsoft LEAP program. Random. My senior year of high school, I started watching Bones and first heard of Anthropology. So I majored in Anthropology. I also majored in German, because I wanted a back up plan in case I decided not to go to grad school for Anthropology, and everybody knows that companies are fighting over German majors. The spring semester of my senior year, I had no plan and my family told me that I needed to get a job, so I hit up Monster and applied to Enterprise’s Management Training program. Randomly, I got the job. After 2 years I decided I didn’t want to do that for the rest of my life. I got on Monster (I should send them a card) and randomly found Codeup. I think it was an ad? Pretty sure I didn’t know what a bootcamp was at the time. After that, it gets less random and more Codeup driven. My first job after Codeup was with a company that had come to my Demo Day. The job after that was with a company that came to do onsite interviews at Codeup. I found out about my current opportunity through Codeup as well. So… three cheers (or jobs) for Codeup! I had taken a computer science class in high school and done well. When I was looking to transition out of the customer service/sales realm, I knew that I wanted a set of hard skills, and luckily Codeup offered a place to grow those. I thought about trying to do something online, like CodeAcademy, but I ended up going with Codeup because of the connections. Where as DIYing your coding education is possible, it’s hard to get your resume through the door if you have no professional experience. Codeup helped make initial connections that have propelled me into the career that I want. Also, I am terrible at making myself watch videos online. I am drawn to programming because there is an answer. If your code doesn’t compile, there is a reason (and probably a silly one at that). It was a nice change of pace coming from a liberal arts background, where things are a little less black and white. Definitely the snacks. It’s hard for a coding school to do this, because it is a business, but a little more clarity upfront about the types of positions to expect (especially in a market like San Antonio), would have been nice. Part of the reason why I decided to do Codeup was the claim that graduates made 15k more afterwards, and so I took out the loan for 15k with the idea that I could pay it back in less than a year. A month in, I realized that the average graduate salary was about 15k less than I was making, so that was a little disappointing and cause some numbers shuffling. Again, I know that’s kind of a hard thing to change, but it’s the only suggestion that I have. Everything else was pretty good.Well, speaking in hindsight, short term was to get paid to program and get some experience on my resume. Long term is to move into a tech arch role, change the world with some awesome software and/or hardware, and become Tony Stark.We’re on the comeup. I would say that San Antonio has a lot of companies that have very robust SWE communities that exist outside of the Downtown/Houston street epicenter. I think that because of the geography of San Antonio (read: sprawl), it is harder to see than a place like Austin or Seattle. Codeup is there to support you. Practically speaking, their success is your success. Aside from that, everyone there is super supportive and just generally nice. If you aren’t understanding a topic, the instructors are willing to help and walk you through it (even on their lunch break. WOW!!!). This is a bit tricky. I would say that first and foremost, know you’re own truth. Software isn’t for everyone, so have that moment of honesty where you decide if you are doing this because you like the idea of programming every day, or because you like the idea of a 6 figure salary in 4 months and working from home everyday (spoiler alert: highly unlikely for your first, or dare I say, second programming job). If you are passionate about building software for the rest of your life, I honestly believe that Codeup is the best place to start that journey. The community is incredible; the instructors are amazeballs; the staff is incredibly supportive; and the founders are boss *** hustlers. It truly is the best place to start your development journey in San Antonio. (P.S. if you are from out of town, forget Codeup. Come to San Antonio for the breakfast tacos, and stay for Codeup.) Dylan sent out an email with some information about the program, and it seemed like an awesome opportunity. If you don’t major in CS, there aren’t a lot of opportunities to “intern” for the Microsofts/Googles/Facebooks of the world. LEAP is awesome, because it gives you that same foot in the door that an internship gives, even if you didn’t go the traditional Computer Science route. (Also: Seattle weather, multitude of hiking trails, coffee). Keep learning. Become Tony Stark. c:\myPath. In other words, Codeup’s Career Services and Development has gotten me 3/3 gigs. That goes to show that just because you get your first job, doesn’t mean that you are out of the family.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/a-quest-through-codeup/,A Quest Through Codeup - Codeup,"Nov 5, 2019 | Codeup NewsCodeup isn’t a cheap program – we know that. As one of the longest accelerators in the country, we recognize that cost is a concern for many prospective students. That’s why this week we are excited to highlight one of our long-standing financial aid partners – Project QUEST – to show you how many pathways are available. First of all, we view your tuition as an investment in your future, and we put our best people, ideas, and efforts to make that investment fruitful. But we also want to make that investment more accessible by providing as many financial pathways as possible for tuition funding. As we approach their annual fundraising luncheon this week, we want to highlight Project QUEST as one of the most effective such pathways you can explore.“The experience of attending Codeup has radically altered my life. Now, instead of financially treading water in a service industry job with a college degree that felt wasted, I have a fulfilling professional career with exciting possibilities for in-field advancement.” – Madeleine CapperProject QUEST is a San Antonio based non-profit dedicated to workforce development and building our city’s future economy. They provide grant funding for educational and training programs, as well as career coaching and support resources (like utilities, childcare, and transportation). Over the last 4 years, Project QUEST and Codeup have collaborated to help dozens of students change careers.“Assistance from Project QUEST was invaluable and empowering. They offer incredible support for career training.” – Jesse RuizIn 2019 alone, Project QUEST has helped Codeup train 23 Software Developers and Data Scientists. Those students received grant funding (i.e. free money) anywhere from $2,000 to a full tuition ride, allowing them to fully focus on their education. Our combined efforts help empower life change, resulting in a 92% completion rate and a 95% employment rate of students receiving Project QUEST funding. And when we say life change, we mean it. The average starting salary leaving our program for Project QUEST participants this year was $59,000! That’s the salary floor, and there’s no ceiling. Considering that many of Project QUEST’s participants come from backgrounds of under or unemployment, these are generationally impactful numbers.“QUEST’s help compounded this opportunity by giving me enough fiscal assistance that I am now on more secure financial footing than I have been in my entire adult life.” – Madeleine CapperIf you’re excited about Project QUEST’s impact on individuals and communities, support their work by donating here!

All of us at Codeup have been working remotely and finding ways to care for ourselves during this transition. We’re pretty excited to celebrate World Mental Health Day, and think you should be, too!

(AKA, Don’t read the book you hate or force yourself to do your least favorite workout.) Here are some recommendations from Codeup team members. Need counseling services? MDlive.com is the way to go! Going through a breakup? There’s an app for that! Use the Mend app and letsmend.com!Too much going on in the world? Try staying off social media for the day.Want to see if you like meditation?

(Just grab a blank sheet of paper, an old set of crayons, and draw whatever comes to mind- just like when you were a kid!)You don’t need us to remind you that mental health is critical right now.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-remote-students/,The Remote Codeup Student Experience - Codeup,"May 1, 2020 | Codeup NewsCommunities across Texas have now lived in a remote environment for weeks. While we hoped for good news early on, Governor Abbott’s recent announcement to close schools for the remainder of the school year has confirmed that the new normal amid COVID-19 is remote. A lot of prospective students are left asking: what now? Our answer is simple: little has changed! While we are now conducting class digitally, the rest of the Codeup experience looks the same. Here’s how!Codeup differs from traditional degrees and online programs because we offer live, full-time, and immersive instruction. Even now, our classes are taught by a team of passionate instructors whose backgrounds range from 20+ years of industry experience to Master Degrees in Adult Education. Each class is led by 2-3 expert instructors and supported by a Teaching Assistant. They deliver live lectures, respond to you in real-time, provide 1:1 support, and individualize your learning to set you up for success. Comparing us to an online boot camp is like comparing a virtual reality experience to a regular TV show. We’re still giving live instruction, we’re just teaching from behind a laptop instead of a podium.In addition to live instruction, our students enjoy live co-learning. You’re not in this alone! In fact, our cohorts of 20-25 students provide a built-in structure of camaraderie, networking, and technical support. Some of the best learning you can do is by teaching to and learning from other students, a benefit that is lost in attending a part-time or self-paced program.The combination of live instruction and peer-peer connectivity produces a third benefit: accountability. In this remote world where your couch is your desk, it can be challenging to stay focused and motivated. Our immersive program builds accountability through a daily course schedule, project-based learning, social support, and a helping hand. [Editor’s note: if this weren’t important and learning to code on your own were easy, I’d be writing Java right now instead of a blog post!]Lastly, the reason Codeup offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee is that we teach directly to the needs of employer partners. Right now, more than ever before, employers need employees who are adaptable and able to work remotely! The remote Codeup experience prepares you to communicate, collaborate, and code remotely, a skill that was already valuable in the tech industry. If anything, you’re getting a little extra bang for your buck by learning a skillset most developers have to earn the hard way.Although we wish we were on campus high-fiving, writing code, and re-enacting Star Wars lightsabers battles, we’ve realized that’s not really what the Codeup experience is about. The true Codeup experience is about learning to code from experienced professionals alongside passionate students in a live, hands-on environment that offers a 100% tuition refund guarantee. That’s what you can always expect from Codeup, whether we’re remote or not.If you’ve been affected by COVID-19 in any way (layoffs, health, family, etc.), check out our recently announced COVID-19 Relief Scholarship.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/why-i-chose-to-teach-at-codeup/,Why I Chose to Teach at Codeup - Codeup,"Jan 16, 2020 | Codeup NewsHi, my name is Douglas Hirsh, and I’m a Web Development Instructor at Codeup Dallas! I’m passionate about technology, software, human behavior, and teaching. As we prepare to launch our first cohort in Dallas, I want to share why I decided to teach at Codeup. Quick about me: I’m a self-taught developer! I have enjoyed an 18 year career in tech, during which I’ve worked at companies ranging from small startups to Fortune 50 and made my way up through the ranks to Senior Developer. I’ve also worked as an instructor at another coding bootcamp and a CTO of a local startup.  How did I hear about Codeup? I saw them post on Slack! I was excited about the idea of returning to teaching, and reached out. We began talking, and I spent over a dozen hours getting to know their team, from management to instruction. During our conversations, I made up my mind: I wanted to work for Codeup. Here’s why! #1: Codeup has a well-thought-out and high-quality curriculum. Not only that, but it teaches programming fundamentals. Some bootcamps teach programs that cover a dozen different technologies: React, Angular, Node, Ruby, Rails, Mongo DB, MySQL, Python, etc. As a developer, I can tell you: that’s crazy. Instead of a list of keywords, I discovered Codeup teaches a narrow scope of technologies with a focus on teaching students how to learn software development, giving them the power to go learn whatever technologies they want. #2: Codeup promises, and follows through, to refund 100% of a student’s tuition if they don’t find a job after graduation. A lot of places say, ‘Hey come on over, we’ll help!’ I knew Codeup was for real and not just a money grab when they told me: “if a student does everything they’re supposed to and doesn’t find a job, that’s on us, not them.” #3: Codeup has an impressive network of employer partners. They place graduates at companies like USAA, Accenture, Oracle, SWBC, and other large companies with a reputation. Having worked at a bootcamp, I know exactly how hard it is to get a company like USAA to consider bootcamp grads. That upped their cred in my book WAY high. #4: Codeup accepts the GI Bill. In my eyes, the government legitimized them with their stamp of approval. Lastly, and most importantly, Codeup helped me realize my passion for helping bring other people into this amazing field. I’m so excited that I get to teach at Codeup, and help so many find a career they love.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/why-codeup-is-bringing-its-software-bootcamp-to-north-texas/,Why Codeup is Bringing Its Software Bootcamp to North Texas - Codeup,"Dec 30, 2019 | Codeup NewsBy Kevin Cummings,  NTX Inno Staff Writer (Dallas Business Journal)—Started in 2013, San Antonio-based Codeup has been making a name for itself and helping bolster Texas’ tech and startup scene by training the next group of software developers. Now, after honing its curriculum and strengthening its ties across the state, Codeup is ready to open its second campus in Dallas.Near the end of November, with the greenlight from the Texas Workforce Commission, the company began accepting applications for its first North Texas cohort that will begin in downtown Dallas in early 2020. It plans to have about 3 cohorts go through its 20-week program, graduating between 50 to 75 people next year.“It seems to make good sense that we should be here; the number of jobs is more than the number of people that can do them and that’s what makes it such a great opportunity right now,” Jason Straughan, CEO and co-founder of Codeup, told NTX Inno. “We want to make sure that we are getting the people that come through our classes jobs, we want our Dallas cohorts to have the same or better employment rates than they do in San Antonio.”What started in the corner of a coworking space in San Antonio, with people walking in and out of the space while trying to teach the class, has quickly become a well-recognized organizations for helping people transition into coding and data careers. It started with a problem Straughan and his fellow co-founders noticed in the industry. Applicants would come in for interviews at their respective companies with a wealth of knowledge about theory, but when it came to practicality and implementation, they seemed to be lacking.“We were talking about how college is teaching people to be computer scientists like you would teach an astronomer how a telescope works,” Straughan said.So Codeup was launched with a simple premise – teach software development like you would teach a skilled trade, with immersive learning. Over the course of the company’s 20-week program, students start coding on day one. The classes go from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and by the end of it, students log about 630 classroom hours of direct experience.“It’s day one you start writing code,” Straughan said. “How do you learn German? You speak it. How do you learn to code? It’s fingers on keyboards, and so that’s what we do.”Codeup distinguishes itself from the numerous other similar programs out there in that it is outcome-driven, rather than profit-motivated. The co-founders of the organization are all involved in the tech industry outside of Codeup, allowing them to focus more on the curriculum than a business plan. Straughan said that in the beginning, instead of thinking about what students want to learn, Codeup went directly to the companies that would be hiring graduates and asked what skills were needed.This has given Codeup a high job placement rate for its graduates, with more than 98 percent of alumni finding jobs in the industry. Codeup stands by its program, offering graduates a complete refund if they are unable to find a software-related job within six months.“Now that we are growing, we’re trying to do it slow to make sure that we maintain that kind of quality on the output, because we think that’s the long-term goal,” Straughan said. “We think it’s actually the most responsible way to deliver and education product.”Straughan credits Codeup’s 28-member team with the success of the company. The connections made from previous graduates has, in part, driven Codeup’s expansion to Dallas. In the past year, the organization has placed 17 graduates in the North Texas area with large companies like USAA and Cognizant. In addition, he said that the growth of the tech industry in the region has made it attractive not only for its relatively high tech salaries, but also because of the number of job openings.When it opens next year in Dallas, Codeup will also focus on helping drive diversity and inclusion in the local tech workforce. The company strives to have cohorts that represent the larger demographics of the region. It also offers scholarships for disadvantaged and minority residents looking to apply. Straughan said that it is something the tech industry should be talking about more, because the software that is being developed is used by all types of people, and those people should be represented at the development of the software as well.“I think one of the other things we really enjoy about Codeup is when I entered software development, almost everybody in that career looked like me – they were all white dudes that liked to play with computers… the industry is changing and it is becoming more diverse, and I think we have an opportunity to help kickstart that and speed up that process,” he said. “I realized that the impact we are making is really a cool experience, it’s moving to me, it really is a purpose.”Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/how-i-paid-43-for-my-codeup-tuition/,How I Paid $43 For My Codeup Tuition - Codeup,"Nov 27, 2019 | Alumni StoriesBootcamps or career accelerator programs are short term education programs designed to help you learn new skills and find a job. If you are thinking about attending one, I will share some tips about finding a bootcamp, my story about how I chose to attend Codeup in San Antonio, TX and how I got funding to attend.My first tip is to spend at least a few months to a year researching the topic you want to study and the bootcamps available. There are tons of resources online to learn programming. I will provide a detailed table below of the courses I took, most of which are free. While you are learning the basics, start to learn about the bootcamps that teach this subject, read through bootcamp curriculum, take notes on tuition costs and start dates and note whether or not they provide scholarships. This first step is crucial for figuring out if this topic is something you are genuinely interested in.Secondly, when you start researching bootcamps, you will find that cost of tuition can be high. The best strategy is to look simultaneously look for funding and bootcamps. First look locally and seek out local and federal grants to attend based on being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field (minorities). I was only able to find funding because I met with a local career training program which enabled me to access local and Department of Labor funds. If you don’t meet the criteria of being being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field, then don’t worry! There are still other scholarships and loans out there.Warning!—only start to contact/call up the bootcamps when you are comfortable with your basic skills in programming (or whatever you are trying to learn) and when you are committed to attending. Bootcamp admissions will aggressively seek you out. They want you to attend their courses. You should have clear intentions about what you want to do, how much money you want to spend, and how good you are at programming. Just be honest with the people you speak to about your circumstances. This is a process so take your time. Often, if you get rejected from a bootcamp, you can still re-apply later.Lastly, there are almost always loan companies that specialize in loan for students of bootcamps. If the cost of tuition is still prohibitive, you can consider loans as your last option. In most cases, these loans can be repaid easily with the job you will (hopefully, most likely) get after you graduate. Some bootcamps offer refunds if you don’t get a job (with conditions) and others offer deferred tuition where you don’t pay anything until you get your first job.As for my experience, I learned about Data Science online and spent 10 months researching the subject and bootcamps. I took a slew of courses online to learn the basics, which I will share below. Then I started to apply to bootcamps. Ultimately, I was able to find Codeup in my hometown. I visited their campus and spoke with their admissions representative about funding. I loved that this school was in my hometown, so it was a practical choice for a full-time program. I also liked the instructors and admissions people that I met. The admissions person told me about their funding options and sent me to a local career training program, which informed me about local and federal grants that were not easily accessible online. Working with this local program was long and uncertain but I stuck with it. The real reasons I was able to get funding through them were because I had been under-employed for years, I had used up all my savings, I was living at home with family and I was unemployed at the time that I applied for the funding. In the end, I chose Codeup because I was able to find funding, it was in my hometown and I genuinely liked the people I met there, especially Maggie Giust, the Senior Data Scientist.I will share a table of the exact funding amounts that I got below. This will probably not be the norm. I got extremely lucky with my funding.All in all, this whole process is precarious, scary and hard. You should give yourself plenty of time to research and learn about the process, the bootcamps and the subject you are trying to study.If you need any advice, please feel free to contact me directly.

https://codeup.com/which-program-is-right-for-me/,Which Program is Right for Me? - Codeup,"Sep 30, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWith our recent program launch, Codeup now offers two technical career tracks: “Full Stack Web Development – Java” and “Data Science.” If you’re a prospective student, you might be wondering which program is right for you! First, we recommend understanding what data science is and what full-stack web development is. Second, ask yourself the following three questions:One key difference between our programs is the prerequisite background knowledge. Our web development program doesn’t have any required skills! Some students enter with no tech experience, and others enter with a lot. Having programming experience is always a plus, but not a must. However, Data Science relies on experience in math, statistics, and basic programming for all incoming students. You’ll need concepts like working with matrices, writing Python functions, and solving systems of equations. That means that you either need coursework in those subjects, self-teaching experience, or on the job training.Your answer to this question isn’t a simple yes/no, but it should help you determine the ramp-up period to one of our programs and which one fits you better now. If you don’t have any math or programming background, web development may be a better fit. If you have a Math or CS degree, data science may be.Do numbers get you hyped up? Do you love or hate excel? Do you really like programming? Do massive data sets feel intimidating or exciting? Do you enjoy statistics and math? Do you like being visually creative? Do you want to build web applications? Do you want to focus just on technical work or mix technical and business work?This list isn’t exhaustive, but it should kickstart your thinking to explore your intrinsic interest in the content of our programs. Try to understand what each profession does day-to-day, and then ask yourself: which gets me more excited? And make sure your answer is brutally honest! Our programs have the same structures, and both career paths are in demand with great opportunity. You’re in great shape either way, but you’ll be much happier with the content that makes you happy.When you graduate from Codeup, we’ll help you land your first job. From the Web Development program, that likely means a job as a software developer, web developer, or programmer. From the Data Science program, that likely means a job as a data scientist, data engineer, or machine learning engineer. But that’s just the first job! As you move through your tech career, you’ll discover new interests and opportunities, like the following.Web Development: web developer (alternative titles: web designer, UI/UX designer, front-end developer, front-end engineer, full-stack developer, software developer), programming, quality assurance technician, technical sales, product/project manager, etc.Data Science: data scientist, analysts of all kinds (data, business, risk, fraud, marketing, web, competitive), customer intelligence, business intelligence, data engineer, dashboard/data visualization developer, machine learning engineer, etc.You now know what data science and full-stack web development are. You have compared your background skills with our program prerequisites. You have thought about what content gets you more excited! And lastly, you’ve considered what future opportunities you’ll want to open for yourself.Did you decide which program is a better fit? Awesome, congrats! You can apply here and begin your journey to a career you love!Still not sure? Let us help!

https://codeup.com/data-science/transition-into-data-science/,What is the Transition into Data Science Like? - Codeup Data Science,"Sep 23, 2020 | Data ScienceAlumni Katy Salts and Brandi Reger joined us at a public panel event to discuss their Transition into Data Science! Keep reading to hear what stands out to them about Codeup, how Codeup helped them launch a career in data science, and what they are up to now.Katy Salts graduated from Codeup’s first Data Science cohort back in June of 2019. She has since started working as a Data Scientist at Cyber Fortress, where she has been for about a year. Prior to joining Codeup, Katy studied and worked in biology. Brandi Reger graduated from Codeup in July of 2020 with our third Data Science cohort. She has since been hired as a Data Engineer at HEB. Prior to joining Codeup, Brandi had just gotten a degree in Geology in pursuit of becoming an Archeologist after serving in the Army for 5 years. She minored in Statistics, which she wanted to pursue further after realizing archeology wasn’t for her.“I didn’t have the ability to take off work and pursue a Masters Degree for 2 years or an undergrad degree for 4 years, and this was the perfect crash course. Also the cost is a lot cheaper than graduate programs and I got a lot of help with grants and scholarships.” – Katy“It’s very applied. You put what you learn into use and you learn why you learned it that way. In collegiate, you’ll take a test but it’s not quite the same thing as getting your hands dirty and figuring it out. Your mind can drift during lecture and you don’t really “get” it until you do a project. But since you’re doing a project on almost every topic at Codeup, that really solidified the topics we were learning for me.” – Brandi“I could not name one programming language. I didn’t know anything. The prework was the first time I wrote a line of code. With Codeup, they will start you from the very beginning of learning programming, it’s just fast-paced.” – Katy“Just get your hands dirty and do it! Once you’re working on it, it turns out it’s not as bad or as hard as you thought it was. Because you don’t know it, it seems like this amazing, glorious thing in the sky but when you actually work on it you’re like ‘oh, it was just that, that’s no big deal.’ All you have to do is try and apply yourself and you’ll figure it out.” – Brandi“The first project we had, our instructor had to go away for the weekend so we couldn’t contact her. The whole class collectively could not come up with an answer to the problem. We were freaking out thinking like ‘We did something wrong. Why can we not figure it out? She left us!’ We were so scared. When she came back she said ‘you learned a really important lesson, and that’s that sometimes there is no answer to the question. You just need to be able to look at the data and take it for what it is.’ You can’t make things up based on the data you find. You have to come up with real conclusions. That one hit me pretty hard and I never forgot it.” – Katy“The prework is the best thing you can do for yourself coming into the program. We didn’t go in knowing everything and memorizing it all, and they didn’t expect us to either. You just have to know basic concepts. Like understand that there’s a way to do something and maybe not necessarily know how yet but know that there’s a way. So just being exposed to it ahead of time is helpful.” – Katy“I really liked being remote. Being in class, it was distracting. My classmates, we were best friends basically while we were going through the program. So we were constantly chatting and everything. But once it was remote it was all quiet. There was nobody distracting me, and I could focus on what I was doing.We could still chat when I wanted to but I could turn off chat when I needed to. Also when the teachers were talking, I had my dual monitors, so I was able to look up what they were talking about and it really solidified what I was learning. So, I got a lot out of it.” – Brandi“They are not messing around! I mean, they start early and they leave no stone unturned! They come in and they’re completely revamping your Linkedin, email, photos, what you should and should not post. One-on-one meetings about what you’re looking for in a company and how they can help you get there, what connections they have, who to talk to, who to connect with. How to answer phone calls. Interview questions in class, like answering them together, answering them one-on-one. Mock interviews, resume building. Beginning to end, I mean, that alone was worth it to go through Codeup because no other place gives you that much attention on one single student, and everybody got that attention, and everybody got jobs! And that’s because of all the work they put into getting you ready not just technically, but professionally. They will get you there if you just listen to them and don’t fight back, don’t argue. Just do what they’re saying because they’ve done this enough times and they know what works. Just trust them.” – Katy“My job is awesome! I get to work from home. It’s definitely constant learning. I think Codeup really prepared me for that because they didn’t just teach me how to code- they taught me how to learn and how to learn quickly. I carried that into my job and my job taught me not only to code but also to be able to apply that to a business model. Learning doesn’t stop after Codeup.” – Katy“I just started a couple of weeks ago so right now a day in the life is reading things and trying to figure out what they are. There are multiple data engineering teams so we all get together and talk about the projects we’re working on and new projects coming down the line. Or we’ll talk to the Data Scientists and they’ll tell us how they’re using our products and what they need from us, and we get to see what happens with the data we’re cleaning and putting together. It’s a constant moving forward and checking in with each other. At this job, you use every programming language you learn at Codeup and 10 others that I don’t even know yet. Everything you learn is useful for something. Codeup teaching you how to learn is very useful because there are still a lot of things I need to learn now.” – Brandi“As a Data Engineer, I clean up the data and put it together in a way that makes sense. We take the data in a nasty, messy state, it’s all over the place, and make it nice and neat so that somebody else can figure something out from it.” – Brandi “You have to think of data science as a spectrum of things and on that spectrum you can specialize in different areas, like just gathering data, or just cleaning, just modeling, just making presentations or dashboards. A lot of businesses don’t know what they actually need. They’ll say they need one thing but really what they’re asking for is something else. So you need to be able to sort through those and ask clear questions in interviews. That was a tough lesson to learn in the job search.” -Katy More personal quotes include Katy saying that this was “the best thing I’ve done” and Brandi saying that the experience “made me a better person.” Thank you both for joining us!

https://codeup.com/data-science/what-is-data-science/,What is Data Science? - Codeup,"Sep 7, 2018 | Data ScienceFirst of all, data science is a method of providing actionable intelligence from data using math, statistics, programming, and business expertise. Like any scientific method, it involves gathering data, identifying a problem, forming a hypothesis, and running tests. More specifically, data scientists follow a process of gathering and cleaning data (wrangling), investigation (exploratory data analysis), building automation using machine learning (feature engineering, model development, and deployment), delivering results (visualizations, reporting, storytelling), and maintenance. Practitioners typically spend 70-80% of their time in the wrangling/exploration, 20% on machine learning models, and the rest in maintenance. Most importantly, this whole process should result in a valuable action or insight for the end-user, i.e. a business or customer! At its core, data is just information – names, dates, times, $$, etc. Data scientists work with large collections of this information to draw conclusions. For example, they might use financial data to predict the seasonality of revenue generation or use the events of applications (like logins, clicks, or downloads) to detect security threats or fraud. Data science typically deals with ‘Big Data,’ which is too large and complex to manage on a local computer (see 4 Vs of Big Data for more). People interact with and create data like this every day: using smartphones, buying houses, rating movies, and more. You can thank data scientists (and the teams supporting them) for guiding you to your favorite Netflix series and helping optimize your workouts. There’s always more than one way to eat an oreo, and data scientists use dozens of different tools. At Codeup, data science tools include Excel, Python (programming language), SQL (databases), Hadoop (distributed data), Jupyter Notebooks (virtual notebooks for doing data science), and Tableau (visualizations). On top of that, they work with concepts from math, stats, and programming to write functions, create charts and graphs, and model patterns. Data science isn’t magic, and it isn’t rocket science either. At Codeup, data science is a skill set just like web development. The need for this discipline across all industries in San Antonio is rapidly growing and looking for new talent.

https://codeup.com/data-science/where-do-data-scientists-come-from/,Where Do Data Scientists Come From? - Codeup,"Oct 24, 2018 | Data ScienceBy Dimitri AntinouOver the last few blog posts, we’ve answered a lot of questions around Data Science: What is it? What’s the difference from data analytics? Which type of program is right for me? If you’re interested in becoming a data scientist, you might be wondering how other people got into the field. Given how new the profession is, most of today’s practitioners probably didn’t study data science formally as undergraduate or graduate students. So today we’re asking: where do data scientists come from?Let’s start broadly by defining the possible pathways into this career. If you’re a Data Scientist, you probably followed one or more of these paths:Each of these pathways has unique advantages and disadvantages across variables like cost, formal credential, length, and pace. A free online program is free and accessible, but takes a lot of dedication to follow through and is harder to change careers with. A bootcamp specializes in quick and efficient job outcomes, but is a big investment. A university offers a formal degree and dives deeper, but is more expensive and takes longer. Each of these pathways also leaves gaps against the complete picture of a data scientist. From your training you might be missing components like: working with real data sets, understanding industry and company demands, using up-to-date technologies, or even just knowing what you don’t know! What’s important to understand here is that different pathways yield strengths and gaps. Your job is to find, acknowledge, and improve your gap areas!Now that we have a framework for understanding potential pathways, let’s look at some data. In preparing to launch Codeup’s immersive Data Science program, we researched over 250 data scientist profiles on LinkedIn and analyzed their educational and career histories. Here’s what we found!95% have a Bachelor’s Degree, 70% have a Master’s Degree, and 27% have a PhD. Of those degrees, the most represented areas of study are: math, stats, business, engineering, and CS.Data Scientists come from an incredibly diverse range of professional backgrounds: psychology research, software development, business analyst, mechanical engineering, and more! We saw a few prominent patterns in our data:A third component of our research was to interview practicing Data Scientists. We asked questions like: What was your path to the field?

https://codeup.com/data-science/quickpath-solving-the-data-science-talent-shortage-with-codeup/,Quickpath: Solving the Data Science Talent Shortage with Codeup - Codeup,"Oct 30, 2019 | Data ScienceAfter the graduation of our first Codeup Data Science cohort, one company was eagerly waiting in the wings to scoop up a lot of our new grads: Quickpath. In business since 2004, Quickpath has helped deliver amazing customer experiences and optimize business decisions in over a hundred implementations for Fortune 500 and Fortune 1,000 companies. But as the demand for their services increased—more than doubling each of the past three years—Quickpath found itself in a talent shortage. “We found ourselves leaving business on the table where customers were asking us for additional resources,” Alex Fly, CEO of Quickpath and board member of the Codeup Data Science program, said, “and we weren’t able to fill that request.”Fortunately, the Codeup Data Science curriculum was able to provide a much-needed pipeline of highly skilled individuals. Over the course of an intense 20-week, hands-on program, students learn a variety of data science tools and skills, including statistics, SQL, Python and regression analysis. This intense preparation, culminating in mastery with a capstone project, is what led Fly to hire not one, but three of our Codeup grads from the inaugural Data Science cohort.Codeup Data Science Grads Making an Immediate ImpactQuickpath is a company that plays data science as a team sport—they really help their clients with all operations around data rather than simply creating a model. This means that Quickpath helps their clients in all the following areas:  Quickpath hired the three Codeup grads as data and machine learning (ML) engineers to work on tasks that come both before and after data model creation. And while you may think of a data science professional as being tucked away in a room doing analysis, this role at Quickpath is very customer-facing, and within a week of being hired, the Codeup grads were already interacting with a number of Quickpath customers.While such a short runway to customer interaction may evoke some nervousness in a new college graduate, the new Codeup hires were able to tap into their previous professional experience and jump right in.Leveraging Previous Experiences for a Data Science RoleFly credits the immediate success of the new Codeup grads to their previous professional experience. While they may not have been in a data science role, these Codeup hires had worked in a corporate environment for years, often using data and analytic skills. One individual, in particular, had been on the receiving end of information from a data science model. In their previous position as an analyst in fraud detection, they would receive data model outputs in order to assess whether transactions were fraudulent. After completing the Codeup Data Science program, this person now sits on the other side of the fence and has the ability to wrangle the data, develop a model and evaluate its success. His professional experience is what sets him apart: he keenly understands how front-line employees will interact with the data that he provides. Fly believes it’s this kind of professional experience that empowers Codeup graduates to hit the ground running. But there’s something more than just previous professional experience. It’s also the sense that Codeup graduates are intrinsically motivated to make a major career change. As our first 2019 Data Science outcomes report noted, 77% of the class had a bachelor’s degree or higher. A person looking to change careers who invests in a 20-week program shows not only moxie but also curiosity. “Data science is constantly moving and evolving at a very high pace. There’s a new library, modeling or deep learning framework coming out literally every week—you’ve got to constantly stay on top of your game,” Fly explained. “So being able to identify folks who are lifelong learners has been a critical success factor for our hiring profile. We found a pretty high concentration of those folks at Codeup.”  Looking Forward: Advice for Future Codeup Data Science StudentsThe demand for professionals with knowledge of data science is not going away anytime soon. Business is continuing to boom for Fly and Quickpath, and he is already looking forward to the next round of graduates. And for those looking to enroll in a future Codeup Data Science boot camp, he has two pieces of advice.First, Fly emphasizes the importance of data, data, data, underscoring that it’s more important than all the algorithms of the world. He believes data preparation is the most fundamental skill to master. “An average data scientist with really good data will always be able to build a better model than an expert data scientist with data,” Fly stressed.Second, he advises that in order to be successful in this field, a person must have a love of learning and can never rest on their laurels.“If you sit still for six months, your skills are out of date,” he advised. “You must have a thirst for knowledge and an ‘always-on’ learning mentality.” Are you looking to reboot your career and become a data scientist or computer programmer? Then it’s time for you to look into Codeup. Our 20-week boot camps will immerse you in the latest technologies and provide you with the skills to make an immediate impact.

https://codeup.com/data-science/everyday-encounters-with-data-science/,Everyday Encounters with Data Science - Codeup,"Mar 11, 2019 | Data ScienceYou come home from work, tired to the bone and groaning as you realize you forgot to prep dinner tonight. So, what do you do? You plop down on the couch, whip out your phone and Google “restaurants near me”. You scroll down the list of places to eat and take into account a variety of factors: how high the ratings are, how many people have rated that restaurant, how far it is from you, whether or not it’s busy at that moment, the keywords mentioned in reviews, how long it’s open… the list goes on. You carefully bookmark each prospective restaurant so you can find it later. All of a sudden, you notice that without your knowledge, three hours have slipped by. You realize with a feeling of dread in your stomach that nearly all the restaurants around you are closed… and you head over to the nearest Whataburger in defeat. A week later, life finds you in the same supine position on the couch, scrolling through restaurants. This time, though, you realize there’s a little compatibility rating next to each restaurant listing. As you scroll, you stumble upon a sushi restaurant that apparently is 90% compatible with your preferences. Without hesitation, you rush there with glee to find that it is everything you could have hoped for! Wow! Data science saves the day!This very relatable experience is a prime example of how many of us have experienced data science in our lives without realizing it. Let’s take a quick moment to analyze how data science played the protagonist in this story. It is important to note that data science is a broad subject that encompasses a variety of things, including first gathering and shaping data, storing that data, then analyzing and visually presenting that data.  Before we can start analyzing data, Google data scientists must first be able to gather information about everything from restaurant locations, hours, pricing, customer reviews, etc. Next, this massive influx of data must be efficiently manipulated and organized so it can quickly be retrieved, Marie Kondo style. Data scientists are then able to take and analyze this data and visually translate it into something that makes sense, such as the graph that displays the busiest hours at the restaurant, or the tidy list of restaurants you see in the app that is ordered by distance from you.A simple action such as filtering by “Open Now” or “Price” requires a tight coordination of all of these steps in order to actually produce the output expected by the user. Amazingly, Google Maps is able to do this analysis real-time to constantly change its results based on your current location. Not only that, it is simultaneously analyzing every single person’s GPS data real-time. This allows them to generate components like the graph of how busy an establishment is at the moment. Another important factor in data science is using analysis to drive predictions (Read more here about the difference between data analytics and data science). For example, in calculating compatibility ratings, the program takes into account Google location history, search history, types of cuisine/restaurants you typically visit or avoid, whether you’ve saved/rated/visited a place or somewhere similar, or simply data that a user inputs about their dietary preferences. It also allows for constant feedback from the user if a compatibility rating seems off, with a “Not Right?” link attached to every rating. In other words, this rating is a prediction of how much you would like a restaurant based on your past history and behavior. So how exactly has Google mastered this compatibility rating? Most likely, data scientists at Google have created algorithms to take the pieces of information listed above to produce a prediction. Essentially, it’s a way for a computer program to act more human. For example, think about how you recommend a show to your best friend. Most likely, you know your friend’s personality and history of shows that they’ve enjoyed, so you generally know what kind of show they may like watching. Similarly, data scientists can use algorithms and statistical models to write code that continuously “learns” to make better predictions, creating an adaptable learning machine. With machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google is able to generate friendly human-like recommendations for over a billion people every single month, which is probably better than what your best friend could do.As the data science field continues to progress and we get closer and closer to true artificial intelligence, we will most likely see the effects of that trickle down into the parts of our everyday life that we hardly consider. We already trust the algorithms and generated recommendations that suggest where or when to eat. Eventually, even something as vital as a life-altering surgery will be dictated by recommendations generated by algorithms for doctors. Understanding and learning about data science will become more significant as it gradually becomes enmeshed with society in ways we may not even be able to fully comprehend.

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-without-a-degree/,From Slacker to Data Scientist: Journey to Data Science Without a Degree,"Jun 11, 2020 | Data ScienceButterflies in my belly; my stomach is tied up in knots. I know I’m taking a risk by sharing my story, but I wanted to reach out to others aspiring to be a data scientist. I am writing this with hopes that my story will encourage and motivate you. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________I don’t have a PhD. Heck, I don’t have any degree. Still, I am very fortunate to work as a data scientist in a ridiculously good company. Here’s how I did it (with a lot of help). It was 1995 and I had just gotten my very first computer. It was a 1982 Apple IIe. It didn’t come with any software but it came with a manual. That’s how I learned my very first computer language: Apple BASIC.My love for programming was born.In Algebra class, I remember learning about the quadratic equation. I had a cheap graphic calculator then, a Casio, that’s about half the price of a TI-82. It came with a manual too, so I decided to write a program that will solve the quadratic equation for me without much hassle.My love for solving problems was born.In my senior year, my parents didn’t know anything about financial aid but I was determined to go to college so I decided to join the Navy so that I could use Montgomery GI Bill to pay for my college. After all, four years of service didn’t seem that long.My love for adventure was born.Later in my career in the Navy, I was promoted as the ship’s financial manager. I was in charge of managing multiple budgets. The experience taught me bookkeeping.My love for numbers was born.After the Navy, I ended up volunteering for a non-profit. They eventually recruited me to start a domestic violence crisis program from scratch. I had no social work experience but I agreed anyway.My love for saying “Why not?” was born. After a few successful years, my boss retired and the new boss fired me. I was devastated. I fell into a deep state of clinical depression and I felt worthless.I recall crying very loudly at the kitchen table. It had been more than a year since my non-profit job and I was nowhere near close to having a prospect for the next one. I was in a very dark space.Thankfully, the crying fit was a cathartic experience. It gave me a jolt to do some introspection, stop whining, and come up with a plan.“Choose a Job You Love, and You Will Never Have To Work a Day in Your Life.” — Anonymous To pay the bills, I was working as a freelance web designer/developer but I wasn’t happy. Frankly, the business of doing web design bored me. It was frustrating working with clients who think and act like they’re the expert on design.So I started thinking, “what’s next?”Searching the web, I stumbled upon the latest news in artificial intelligence. It led me to machine learning which in turn led me to the subject of data science.I signed up for Andrew Ng’s machine learning course on Coursera. I listened to TwitML, Linear Digression, and a few other podcasts. I revisited Python and got reacquainted with git on Github.My love for data science was born.It was at this time that I made the conscious decision to be a data scientist. Learning something new was fun for me. But still, I had that voice in my head telling me that no matter how much I study and learn, I will never get a job in data science without a degree.So, I took a hard look in the mirror and acknowledged that I needed help. But I wasn’t sure where to look.Then one day out of the blue, my girlfriend asked me what data science is. I jumped off my feet and started explaining right away. Once I stopped explaining to catch a breath, I managed to ask her why she asked. And that’s when she told me that she’d seen a sign on a billboard. We went for a drive and I saw the sign for myself. It was a curious billboard with two big words “data science” and a smaller one that says “Codeup.” I went to their website and researched their employment outcomes.I was sold. Before the start of the class, we were given a list of materials to go over.Given that I had only about two months to prepare, I was not expected to finish the courses. But, I did them anyway. I spent day and night going over the courses and materials, did the tests, and got the certificates! I knew then that I could get into data science without a degree. Codeup was a blur. We had a saying in the Navy about the bootcamp experience: “the days drag on but the weeks fly by.” This was definitely true for the Codeup bootcamp as well.We were coding in Python, querying the SQL database, and making dashboards in Tableau. We did projects after projects. We learned about different methodologies like regression, classification, clustering, time-series, anomaly detection, natural language processing, and distributed machine learning.More important than the specific tools, I learned:  Our job hunting process started from day one. We updated our LinkedIn profile and made sure that we were pushing to Github almost every day. I even spruced up my personal website to include the projects we did during class. And of course, we made sure that our resumé was in good shape.Codeup helped me with all of these.In addition, Codeup also helped prepare me for both technical and behavioral interviews. The student placement team taught me how to optimize answers to highlight my strengths as a high-potential candidate. My education continued even after graduation. In between filling out applications, I wrote code every day and tried out different Python libraries. I regularly read the news for the latest developments in machine learning. While doing chores, I would listen to a podcast, a TedTalk, or a LinkedIn learning video. When bored, I listened to or read books about data or professional development.I’ve had a lot of rejections. The first one was the hardest but after that, it kept getting easier. I developed a thick skin and learned to keep moving. It took me 3 months after graduating from Codeup to get a job. When I got the job offer, I felt very grateful, relieved, and excited.I could not have done it without Codeup and my family’s support. It is possible to start a career in data science without a degree!____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________This blog post was written by Ednalyn C.

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-in-the-real-world/,Data Science in the Real World - Codeup,"Jun 24, 2019 | Data ScienceFor some, it may be difficult to grasp how prevalent data science is in our world! I’ve written a post here that brings to life some of the ways in which you may see data science in your everyday routine. However, you may find yourself wondering exactly how far-reaching data science actually is, or how it actually impacts certain industries or companies. In this post, I’ll go a little deeper into these topics.For one, data science has been a major player in industries like manufacturing and retail. For example, in manufacturing, data science is utilized from an insight-driven perspective. Simply put, it’s how businesses use data to figure out how to best utilize their resources when making and producing a large-scale product they’re trying to sell to customers. For instance, a business may collect data on how the customer interacts with the product in order to figure out what features are most profitable to produce. They may also collect data related to how well the machinery is operating on the production line so they can analyze weak points and optimize efficiency. For example, Ford utilizes wireless connections and in-vehicle sensors to capture insights on driver behavior as well as ways to increase production speed.In retail, we also see a similar move towards an insight-driven perspective, one that allows businesses to use predictive analytics by utilizing data from product reviews, call center records, and social media streams. On a merchandising front, businesses like Target and Walmart may even utilize data collected from video footage or track heat signatures in order to improve layout and product placements. If you have ever wondered why you can’t walk out of Target without spending at least a hundred bucks, now you know why! Basic industrial-organizational psychology usually places the most utilized items, like milk and eggs, in a place further into the store so that customers must walk past a plethora of products that they don’t need but may end up buying due to product placement. What has become even more significant than brick-and-mortar stores, however, are online retailers, such as Amazon. Because of the huge variety of items to choose from, many customers may feel overwhelmed by how many options there are when they visit the website. However, because Amazon is so great at collecting data on customers and then turning that raw data into valuable predictors, they make it much easier for the average consumer to buy products suited for them. For example, to figure out what items to recommend users, they collect data on what items that user browses through and what they end up buying. Amazon also takes into account the user’s shipping address, which lets them reliably predict what income a user may have. All these little tidbits of information allow them to build a 360-degree model of who this individual so that they can associate them with a group of people that also have the same identifiers. Grouping users can help Amazon make assumptions about what you will buy based on what others buy in your grouping. If you buy Burt’s Bees Lip Balm with a predicted income of 53k, they may come to the conclusion that people in this category also have a high rate of buying Bounty Quick-Size Paper Towels, which they can then recommend you buy next. In many ways, it’s exactly like what Target does with product placement when someone walks into the store. However, because Amazon lacks a physical storefront they must instead strategically place products around the web page in order to create the same passerby effect.  On a larger scale, this is essentially how advertising works on all the social media platforms you may find yourself scrolling through. One one hand, they may collect data on you in order to predict which advertisements your group of users may relate with. However, they may also track your individual data and essentially stalk you with little bits of code called cookies. For example, one time while scrolling through Instagram, I saw an ad for my absolute favorite chai brand that’s manufactured in the town of my alma mater, the University of Colorado at Boulder. I caught myself thinking, “ How in the world did they know?” The ad was so specific to my preferences that it caught me off guard. I’m assuming at some point I had Googled this brand of chai and the browser cookies were used by Instagram to target users with that specific interest, which is in general how most targeted advertising works. The weird part is, I couldn’t recall ever Googling it… The fact of the matter is, many businesses are collecting data on behaviors you may not even realize. Some say that Facebook records users through their phones or that Alexa is listening to you without your knowledge. The truth is, we have reached an age in which data is a highly valued commodity. As demonstrated by the near failure of footwear company Timberland, how a company uses data can either make or break them. As data becomes increasingly important in our world, the demand for data scientists will be even higher.  If you’re interested in becoming a data scientist, check out Codeup’s program here. It’s a 20-week hands-on accelerator that will teach you all the technical skills you need to know in order to jumpstart a career in Data Science. —Joyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-vs-data-analytics-whats-the-difference/,Data Science VS Data Analytics: What’s The Difference? - Codeup,"Oct 17, 2018 | Data ScienceBy Dimitri AntoniouA week ago, Codeup launched our immersive Data Science career accelerator! With our first-class kicking off in February and only 25 seats available, we’ve been answering a lot of questions from prospective students. One, in particular, has come up so many times we decided to dedicate a blog post to it. What is the difference between data science and data analytics?First, let’s define some of our terms! Take a look at this blog to understand what Data Science is. In short, it is a method of turning raw data into action, leading to the desired outcome. Big Data refers to data sets that are large and complex, usually exceeding the capacity of computers and normal processing power to deal with. Machine Learning is the process of ‘learning’ underlying patterns of data in order to automate the extraction of intelligence from that data.  Now, let’s look at the data pipeline that data scientists work through to reach the actionable insights and outcomes we mentioned:Data professionals work at different stages of the spectrum to move data through the pipeline. On the left, Big Data Engineers specialize in collecting, storing, and processing data, getting it from Data to Information. In the middle, analysts work to understand and convert that information to knowledge. Lastly, a Machine Learning Engineer utilizes machine learning algorithms to turn intelligence into action by building automations, visualizations, recommendations, and predictions.Data Scientists span multiple stages of this pipeline, from information to action. They will spend about 70% of their time wrangling data in the information stage. They will conduct a statistical analysis to derive knowledge. Lastly, they predict future events and build automations using machine learning.For those technical folk out there, data science is to data engineering or machine learning engineering as full-stack development is to front-end or back-end development. For the non-technical folk, data science is the umbrella term that houses data analytics, machine learning, and other data professions.So what’s the biggest difference between a data analyst and a data scientist? Data scientists utilize computer programming and machine learning in addition to mathematics and statistics. Still have questions?

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-myths/,Data Science Myths - Codeup,"Oct 31, 2018 | Data ScienceBy Dimitri Antoniou and Maggie GiustData Science, Big Data, Machine Learning, NLP, Neural Networks…these buzzwords have rapidly spread into mainstream use over the last few years. Unfortunately, definitions are varied and sources of truth are limited. Data Scientists are in fact not magical unicorn wizards who can snap their fingers and turn a business around! Today, we’ll take a cue from our favorite Mythbusters to tackle some common myths and misconceptions in the field of Data Science. Myth #1: Data Science = StatisticsAt first glance, this one doesn’t sound unreasonable. Statistics is defined as, “A branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of masses of numerical data.” That sounds a lot like our definition of Data Science: a method of drawing actionable intelligence from data. In truth, statistics is actually one small piece of Data Science. As our Senior Data Scientist puts it, “Statistics forces us to make assumptions about the nature of the relationship between variables, the distribution of the data, etc.” In the traditional Data Science venn diagram, you’ll see that math/stats make up ⅓ of a working professional. These are tools and skills to leverage, but data science itself is about drawing intelligence from data.BUSTEDvia GIPHY Myth #2: Data Scientist = Business/Data AnalystThis one is so common that we wrote a whole post about it! These are separate and different roles within the data field. While a data scientist will often do analytics, their spectrum of work is wider. A data analyst will use structured data to create dashboards and KPIs, while a Data Scientist deals with unstructured and messy data for a range of outputs. If they’re interested, business analysts will often progress to data scientists.BUSTEDvia GIPHY Myth #3: Data Science = Data ScienceThis one’s tricky, because it’s impossible to either confirm or bust! The ‘myth’ is that one person or company using the term Data Science is not necessarily the same as another person or company using the same term. Depending on organizational capacity, individual experience, educational background, and many other variables, we might be using the same name for different animals.Tl;dr: don’t assume a common understanding across hiring managers, recruiters, and practitioners. Look instead for specifics of tools, techniques, methodologies, and outputs. That being said, this one falls in the “plausible” category, because it may actually be true in some circumstances, while false in others.PLAUSIBLEvia GIPHY Myth #4: Data Science curricula are well-defined and consistent.We recommend checking this one out for yourself! A quick google search for bootcamps, master’s degree programs, and online courses will reveal that different organizations teach different things. There is no commonly accepted framework for teaching data science! Some focus more on the engineering, others focus more on machine learning, some think deep learning is foundational, and some prefer to use R. Our curriculum was built through employer interviews, practitioner interviews, market research, and company partnerships. But we’re based in Texas! A bootcamp in New York might follow the same process and end up with a different syllabus. Keep in mind, whatever your learning path, that there will be gaps in your learning. The most important thing is to recognize those gaps.BUSTEDvia GIPHY Myth #5: If I want to be a data scientist, I just need to learn Python or R.This one is common and dangerous! Just like statistics, programming languages like Python and R are tools. They’re just pieces of a larger puzzle! Knowing Python without understanding the data science pipeline is like knowing how to build a floor without having a floor plan. Of course, these are valuable technical skills that give you a leg up, but they’re second in importance to asking the right questions, knowing what tools to use when, and communicating your findings.BUSTEDvia GIPHYStill have questions?

https://codeup.com/data-science/what-is-machine-learning/,What is Machine Learning? - Codeup Data Science,"Aug 26, 2020 | Data ScienceThere’s a lot we can learn about machines, and there’s a lot machines can learn about us, too! Ever wonder how virtual personal assistants or dating apps work? Or how Netflix picks the perfect show for you? They’re learning from you by optimizing and building upon human-created algorithms. Each text you type, person you swipe, or show you pick is stored as data, and through a process called machine learning, that data is plugged into algorithms to streamline your next texting, dating, or show-picking experience.Let’s take any entertainment streaming service. It stores information about the titles you’ve watched, like genre, actors, year, category, and how (if) you rated them, in order to recommend other titles you may also enjoy. It also considers what other titles members with similar preferences have enjoyed. All of this data is stored and used as input in algorithms, which are sets of rules that solve a problem. The problem, in this case, is that you might like to have a new show to watch.As you continue interacting with your entertainment streaming service, the better the recommendations will be, because the more data it has on what you choose to watch. Yes! Well, it’s learning what humans tell it to learn. The same way we might read through a book given to us to study and memorize course material, the computer gathers and stores the data we tell it to store. However, we can choose to go beyond that book and learn from other sources by running an internet search or asking others. The machine lacks the intelligence to do this on its own, but if it was programmed to do so by a human, it could.Wikipedia defines machine learning as “the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.” The key word here is “automatically.” A human manually sets up an algorithm that the machine uses to come to conclusions, but the more data the machine has, the more it has to “learn” from to improve its conclusions, without the need for a human programmer. However, the machine is only improving upon the algorithm, optimizing the output it gives with the more data it has, and not creating its own algorithms. Humans will always be needed to tell the machines what to do.If this sounds cool to you, have you ever considered a career in data science? There are a number of fascinating things to learn about data science and machine learning, and the best way to learn is with hands-on experience through numerous projects and fully-immersive learning.

https://codeup.com/data-science/ds-mentors/,Meet Your Data Science Instructors! - Codeup,"Jan 23, 2020 | Data ScienceIn February 2019, Codeup launched the very first (and still the only) Data Science career accelerator based in San Antonio (but available remotely all across Texas). Our first class graduated 17 students with an 88% employment rate for an average starting salary of $72,000. In January 2020, our second class is cranking through their final capstone projects, in which they take a Data Science project to life. As we gear up to launch our 3rd class in February 2020, let’s take a moment to introduce you to the incredible data science instructors ready to help you change careers. Between them, Maggie Giust, Zach Gulde, and Ryan Orsinger have over 20 years of technical industry experience. They’ve worked as data analysts, data scientists, software developers, curriculum developers, instructors, and more. They’ve worked at large companies like Rackspace and HEB, and smaller companies like Whiskr and Grok Interactive. Together, they have over 12 years of teaching experience at Codeup and the university levelAs we’ve talked about before (see: What is Data Science blog), Data Science is the intersection of programming, math/stats, and domain expertise. That means that in order to learn this material and make a successful career transition, it’s even more important in this field than any other to have a diverse set of instructor backgrounds. Let’s break down our staff expertise by those categories:Domain expertise: Domain expertise means having deep technical experience AND applying that experience across multiple industries and domains. Maggie has worked in data science for 7 years and data roles for 10. Maggie worked in finance, practicing data science for security intelligence with Capital Group, built machine learning recommender systems for consumer retail at HEB, and produced data science insights at Rackspace to improve customer satisfaction.  Prior to joining Codeup, Maggie’s educational experience includes teaching high school math as well as the development and delivery of data science content and curriculum at both Codeup and Trinity University, where she serves as an adjunct instructor of data science.Zach has been instructing, writing curriculum, and programming internal applications for Codeup since 2016. He has instructed hundreds of programmers and is Codeup’s principle curriculum developer. If you printed out all the curriculum Zach has authored for both Data Science and Web Development, it would be more than 1000 pages. In addition to his work with Codeup, Zach has worked on big data projects in the travel industry.Ryan began building web applications for small and medium-sized businesses in 2007 and has written software ranging from custom CRM systems for real estate brokerages to an event management platform for Dell. As Codeup’s most senior instructor, Ryan has instructed and mentored 37 data scientists and over 500 software developers.This means that you will learn what businesses value from instructors who are experienced practitioners who have created technical solutions for multiple industries.Math/Stats: Maggie holds a BS in Mathematics from UTSA and is currently working on her Master’s degree in Data Analytics. Ryan holds a BA from Trinity University in economics. In addition to building out the statistics curriculum for Codeup’s Data Science program, Zach is working on his degree in Software Development. One of our students said they learned more in one week of stats at Codeup than an entire semester at college. Programming: This is really where we shine! Zach and Ryan have been teaching at Codeup for 4 years in our web development program and have developed special depth of expertise in programming and teaching programming. They each have experience across OOP in Java, PHP, and Python, as well as database experience in SQL and web framework expertise in Laravel and Spring. They each have experience in both object oriented and functional programming, and experience building database-backed full-stack web applications in numerous languages (including Python, Java, Javascript, and Clojure) and web frameworks. Maggie has been working in R and Python for years in her different data science roles. When it comes to programming, these 3 can not only build you a Machine Learning model, but they can build a full-stack application, hosting infrastructure, database, and simple UI to go along with it.What does this mean for you? When you join Codeup, you step into a classroom where the diverse skills needed in the field are represented in spades in your instructional staff. Not only that, but these are three incredible human beings with a passion for education and up-leveling others.

https://codeup.com/data-science/codeup-wins-civtech-datathon/,Codeup Wins CivTech Datathon - Teams of Codeup grads take 1st and 2nd,"Jul 30, 2020 | Data Science CivTechSA is a partnership between Geekdom, a coworking space that every current Codeup student has complimentary access to, and San Antonio’s Office of Innovation. In an effort to connect local communities, ideas, and data to help improve the City’s services, the CivTech Datathon competition was born! Using public datasets, competitors look for missing data and areas for improvement and identify impactful solutions to current civic problems. Then, they present their insights to City of San Antonio departments like San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and Via Metropolitan Transit.Boasting first place was the Curie team We Came, We SAWS, We Conquered with Ryan McCall, David Wederstrandt Sr., Chase Thompson, Cameron Taylor, and Jeremy Cobb. They used data from SAWS regarding sanitary sewer overflow (SSO) events and weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association to predict the root causes of SSO events. They generated a system that SAWS could use to prioritize maintenance of the sewers to limit the risk of these events, with the potential to save hundreds of millions of city dollars while keeping gastrointestinal health risks at bay.Taking second place was team Get on the Bus with Sean Oslin, Sara Pena, Fredrick Lambuth, Misty Garcia, Kevin Eliasen, and Faith Kane. With their project, they aim to increase ridership of public transportation. Using open data from VIA and the Census Bureau Data API, this team identified areas of improvement to make our community more diverse and equitable by making buses more accessible.As a special shoutout, at the 2019 CivTech Datathon, a team from our very first Data Science cohort competed and won the “Most Solvable” award. The team members were Ednalyn C. De Dios, Joseph Burton, and Sandra Graham. Their project was similar to our Curie team – they trained a model to predict which pipes would overflow.If you’re passionate about improving civic issues and want to present your findings to city stakeholders too someday, Codeup can teach you how! You might actually inspire lasting change (or at least get thousands of dollars in prize money)! If these Codeup students could win first and second place at the datathon, what’s stopping you?

https://codeup.com/data-science/what-is-python/,What is Python? - Codeup - Data Science Explained!,"Sep 9, 2020 | Data ScienceIf you’ve been digging around our website or researching tech tools, you may have heard of Python. Python is a programming language that can be used by software developers, accountants, mathematicians, and especially, data scientists. Python is actually the dominant programming language in data science, often used for data wrangling, analysis, visualization, and machine learning.Python is an object-oriented language, meaning that the focus is on data and procedures rather than functions and logic. By writing out procedures, you can actually modify the data you have. It can help you automate mundane, repetitive tasks, such as downloading websites, changing the format of those websites, renaming those files, and uploading them to servers. With Python, you can program all of these tasks to be done automatically every time you download a website. This automation saves data scientists a lot of time. Yes! One of the key features of Python is the short, easy to understand syntax in which you write your code. Its minimalistic nature allows you to focus on solving your problem rather than solving the code itself. It reads and feels more like English as compared to other common programming languages. Sometimes, what would take you 4 lines of code in Java can be done with 1 line of code in Python. Because it is a high-level language, meaning it is largely independent of your computer specifications, you can get started using Python on whatever device you have – even phones, tablets, or PlayStation!Python can be used for data wrangling, data analysis, data visualizations, and applying machine learning algorithms. Data wrangling involves preparing raw data for use by parsing it, meaning to convert each data point to a standard format, and by cleaning it, which means to separate useful data from erroneous or missing data points. This is relatively easy if you have only a few data points, but parsing Big Data by hand, like a thousands-of-terabytes large list of every transaction a retail store has ever had, is out of the question. So, Python is used to automate these tasks. It’s also used for data analysis – helping you find trends, correlations, variations, and outliers; data visualizations – helping you chart or graph your findings to show to others; and machine learning, as the complex algorithms and workflows that it’s capable of make it great for Artificial Intelligence.While this all sounds quite complex, remember, every data scientist started out knowing nothing about Python.

https://codeup.com/data-science/career-in-data-science/,The Best Path to a Career in Data Science - Codeup,"May 14, 2020 | Data ScienceIn our blog, “The Best Path To A Career In Software Development,” we looked at how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career than traditional undergraduate CS degree programs. Today we’re here to talk to you about how bootcamps provide a more direct path to a career in data science than a Master’s Degree. “But don’t I need a degree to get a job as a data scientist?” As a non-traditional educational model, we hear this concern a lot. The answer is yes and no. Yes, because most jobs in data science require some form of higher education. No, because that degree doesn’t have to be in something related to data science – data scientists have degrees in many different areas of study! So if the concern that lacking a piece of paper will prevent you from accelerating your career, fear no more.While a Master’s Degree provides a lot of value, it isn’t the most direct path for a job. With the exponential growth in data generation and the race to keep up with storing and processing that data, data science no longer sits at the fringe of an ultra-specialized workforce. Companies now need much larger teams to analyze, model, and leverage the data they’ve collected. So while the field of data science might have once only been available to those skilled in highly academic algorithm development, it’s now a playground for those with some Python skills who know how to find valuable insights in a mess of data.  Now let’s get a bit more specific. If modern roles in data science demand more practical skills, why is a bootcamp a better path? #1: Responsive curriculum: Barely 10 years ago nobody had heard of data science. But in that short amount of time, the tools and technologies in the field have grown exponentially. Each year sees the introduction of new packages, visualization tools, and cutting edge technologies. With such a rapidly evolving landscape, it’s hard for traditional learning environments to keep pace. With our ears tuned directly to employers, we’re able to adapt quickly and ensure we’re teaching what hiring managers need. #2 Hands-on Project-Based Learning: Have you ever watched Top Chef or The Great British Bake Off? You were probably pretty entertained, but how did that seared Ahi Tuna with orange mint avocado salsa and balsamic vinegar reduced amuse-bouche turn out? The sad reality is, watching experts do their thing doesn’t make you an expert. Nor does listening to lectures. Our program is built around the concept of praxis, which is essentially the practical application of theory, or the blending of theory and practice. Half of your 670 program hours are spent actually writing code, so you develop the muscle memory and experience of programming. A career in data science is like an old-time trade, like becoming a blacksmith: you have to learn from masters and practice, practice, practice.  #3 Progressive Curriculum Structure: In a traditional degree, students study by taking several classes at a time. You may begin with data structures and algorithms, then move to SQL, then take Python, and so on. But real-world data science doesn’t work so neatly. You will never face a project where you’re only working with one of those tools, so this pedagogical method is misaligned with career demands. Our program focuses on real-world deliverables at every step of the journey, while exposing you to increasingly complex problems and projects. You start off applying basic tools to simple challenges. Then, we begin varying the data sets, the way you access that data, the type of methodology you use, and the deliverable you’re responsible for. To put it simply, the structure of a traditional degree teaches you how to use a hammer, a saw, and a chisel. Codeup teaches you how to build a stool, a birdbox, and a sculpture with those tools, and when to use which.  #4 Job Placement Services: If education is your goal, stop reading now. If a career is your goal, then you’re in the right place. Most graduate institutions have career service offices where you can get advice on your resume and attend job fairs. But Codeup makes you a promise: get a job after graduation or get 100% of your money back. There are no two ways about that: our singular focus is your outcome. Unlike traditional institutions, we sell jobs, not education.  #5 Messy Data: This is probably the most important difference between us and traditional degrees. We use real, messy, misleading, broken data so you learn how to draw insights from the real thing. Unfortunately, that is not the norm. Because of the segmented class structure, traditional degrees have to focus on using data that teach one specific skill. At Codeup, you’re always applying your tools to a real deliverable, so we’re able to use real data sets that intersect the challenges of multiple skills.  Lastly, we encourage you to think about the return on your investment in your education.*read more on our outcomes Most importantly, the opportunity cost of pursuing a master’s degree is equal to 13-19 months of employment. At a median salary of $67,500 from Codeup, that’s between $67,500-$101,250 in foregone earnings. So, you want a career in data science? A career accelerator like Codeup is the path for you.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/the-job-fair-is-over-now-what-post-job-fair-tips/,The Job Fair is Over....Now What? Post Job Fair Tips - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Tips for Prospective Students We’ve written about how to kill it at the job fair and how to leave a lasting impression at the Job Fair. But, what happens when the Job Fair doors close?Here at Codeup, we’re passionate about bridging the gap between talent and demand, so we’ve outlined helpful tips to ensure you continue bringing your A-game and leave a lasting impression!Don’t let yourself become someone they barely remember. Find the recruiters on LinkedIn and connect with them.why you want to connect with them. Consider recapping conversations you had at the job fair and reiterating what position(s) in which you were interested. Don’t blindly connect – remind them of who you are!Use social media to your advantage! Companies are more connected than ever before, so what better way to show you’re interested than by following them on social media? Some key ones include LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and possibly even Instagram. But, WHY social media? You’ll be constantly in the loop of what the companies are up to and what they’re in the business of doing. As a result, you stay relevant.In the advent of social media, apps are also on the rise. Set up alerts through your favorite job sites – almost all of which have apps.Here’s a few that our Director of Employer Partnerships recommend:Do you have two resumés? It’s best to have two – one that is tailored for the role you want and one tailored to recruiters. Hand out the latter one to recruiters or at job fairs. It should also highlight the well roundedness of who you are!Step one: do you have a cover letter? Step two: is it one that can be tailored with minimal effort? While most companies nowadays don’t require a mandatory cover letter, it’s good to have one on file. This link has great tips on prepping one.A good recruiter won’t view working with you as a transaction. Working with a recruiter allows you to a) outsource a significant portion of the job search while also gaining a direct connection to a professional network b) give you access to a transparent job search process (such as company culture and interviewer style). In addition, it’s in a recruiter’s best interest to stay in touch with you once you accept an offer to make sure you’re adjusting. You’re not a transaction – you’re an investment. When they see you continue to succeed, it allows them to stay at the top of your mind as you continue your professional path.Does your LinkedIn reflect that you’re wanting to hear from recruiters? This is an often overlooked step, but is key when actively job searching.The next Tech Job Fair is scheduled for September 2018. Until then, we wish you all the best of luck as you continue navigating through the job search!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/which-program-is-right-for-me/,Which Program is Right for Me? - Codeup,"Sep 30, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWith our recent program launch, Codeup now offers two technical career tracks: “Full Stack Web Development – Java” and “Data Science.” If you’re a prospective student, you might be wondering which program is right for you! First, we recommend understanding what data science is and what full-stack web development is. Second, ask yourself the following three questions:One key difference between our programs is the prerequisite background knowledge. Our web development program doesn’t have any required skills! Some students enter with no tech experience, and others enter with a lot. Having programming experience is always a plus, but not a must. However, Data Science relies on experience in math, statistics, and basic programming for all incoming students. You’ll need concepts like working with matrices, writing Python functions, and solving systems of equations. That means that you either need coursework in those subjects, self-teaching experience, or on the job training.Your answer to this question isn’t a simple yes/no, but it should help you determine the ramp-up period to one of our programs and which one fits you better now. If you don’t have any math or programming background, web development may be a better fit. If you have a Math or CS degree, data science may be.Do numbers get you hyped up? Do you love or hate excel? Do you really like programming? Do massive data sets feel intimidating or exciting? Do you enjoy statistics and math? Do you like being visually creative? Do you want to build web applications? Do you want to focus just on technical work or mix technical and business work?This list isn’t exhaustive, but it should kickstart your thinking to explore your intrinsic interest in the content of our programs. Try to understand what each profession does day-to-day, and then ask yourself: which gets me more excited? And make sure your answer is brutally honest! Our programs have the same structures, and both career paths are in demand with great opportunity. You’re in great shape either way, but you’ll be much happier with the content that makes you happy.When you graduate from Codeup, we’ll help you land your first job. From the Web Development program, that likely means a job as a software developer, web developer, or programmer. From the Data Science program, that likely means a job as a data scientist, data engineer, or machine learning engineer. But that’s just the first job! As you move through your tech career, you’ll discover new interests and opportunities, like the following.Web Development: web developer (alternative titles: web designer, UI/UX designer, front-end developer, front-end engineer, full-stack developer, software developer), programming, quality assurance technician, technical sales, product/project manager, etc.Data Science: data scientist, analysts of all kinds (data, business, risk, fraud, marketing, web, competitive), customer intelligence, business intelligence, data engineer, dashboard/data visualization developer, machine learning engineer, etc.You now know what data science and full-stack web development are. You have compared your background skills with our program prerequisites. You have thought about what content gets you more excited! And lastly, you’ve considered what future opportunities you’ll want to open for yourself.Did you decide which program is a better fit? Awesome, congrats! You can apply here and begin your journey to a career you love!Still not sure? Let us help!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/thinking-about-a-bootcamp-to-transition-careers/,Thinking About a Bootcamp to Transition Careers? - Codeup,"Jan 20, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWhen I was researching ways to transition my career from education to the tech field, I wasn’t really sure about the questions I should be asking myself. It’s hard to know what you should be thinking about when it comes to doing something you’ve never done before; the more drastic the transition, the more difficult it is to know! For me, time was a deciding factor because I’m an adult with a family and all of the responsibilities that come along with that role. I knew I wanted a non-traditional path to my new career, and that’s how I found Codeup, a career accelerator in Texas. A year and a half after I started researching my options, I’m a month away from completing Codeup’s Data Science program, and I have a much better idea of what you might want to think about if you’re starting to do your own research. There are so many things to consider when planning a major transition in your life, but asking yourself these five questions is a good place to start. Your answers and your journey will be uniquely yours, so don’t be discouraged if they look different from other students in your chosen program. Even with the growing appreciation for diversity in our workplaces, it can be intimidating to pursue your passion if you have a non-traditional background; trust me, I know! All I can tell you is that there is room for passionate and committed people in every field, so do your research and go get your dream life.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________WRITTEN BY __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Follow Faith’s blog on medium for more incredible content like this, and click the link above to connect with her on Linkedin!Stay in the know with student stories and information that is sure to help you on your career journey, and keep up with our free events all by joining our newsletter!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/anxious-about-the-job-fair/,Anxious About the Job Fair - Codeup,"Aug 29, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsI hope you’ve got your resumes ready, because Codeup’s bi-annual Tech Job Fair is coming back this Fall! For most people, this is an exciting event, full of opportunity and new beginnings. While for some, the words “Job Fair” provoke anxiety and a deep-seated fear of proper handshaking.(via GIPHY)To help a few of you entry-level folks out there, I sat down with my boss Fred Tawil – President of Swipetrack Solutions – and asked him if he had some advice for anyone attending the Job Fair in September.Interview With the BossHow did you get into tech?I taught myself how to program years and years ago. When I graduated as a political science major, I needed something to do. My dad owned bingo halls and he needed a player tracking system, so I figured okay, I’ll make a player tracking system. I taught myself how to program, I built the kiosk and built the software to run the player tracking.As someone who didn’t formally study something like CS, what has been the most difficult thing about managing a bunch of programmers? I don’t know. Everybody has their own method of programming and development. It’s that balancing act between getting something done quick and getting it done right. It’s figuring out how much time we can spend making it reliable versus getting it deployed.That’s true. There’s always something new coming out in this industry.Yeah, it’s always good to keep an eye out on what’s coming up, that way you’re not stuck when something gets depreciated or reaches its end-of-life.When you’re hiring, do you typically read everyone’s resumes?It depends. We typically glance at them. I understand that a lot of Codeup grads weren’t in tech and are trying to move into it. That’s actually good for us, especially as a small company. We like to see previous work history so we can hire someone with multiple skills.Back when you were conducting the interviews yourself, what are some things that would make a candidate stand out to you?Most of the time when we’re hiring, we get a lot of competent coders that come to see us, and we see lots and lots of resumes. But an important thing for us now is, will this person fit in with the environment and will they like working here? When it comes down to the interview, you can be a competent coder, but what we want to know is if you’ll mesh with the group of people here and if you’re someone we can work with day to day.How important would you say it is for someone to have a personal website and to have recent commits on GitHub?I can tell you we looked at everyone’s personal website if their resume looked good. GitHub accounts not so much, because a lot of the time when someone is coming from a coding bootcamp they’re all the same. A lot of the websites also looked similar, but if there was a way that you set yours apart, we saw those and those were pretty interesting.For us it’s not so much what you did while you were at Codeup, it’s what else you did. Show me that you really enjoy programming and that you do it in your free time, as opposed to just looking for a higher paycheck. Do you have any apps in the App store, or a web application you made? Did you actually spend time on your website? I can tell you we do look at the source code and make sure if we’re hiring somebody that they didn’t just use a theme they bought on the internet and are pretending they built it. It’s very easy to tell.Do you have any advice for anyone who is nervous about going to their first Tech Job Fair? It might be different, but I think it’s more laid-back. I would say to just relax. The three or four times we did it, we enjoyed talking to people and finding those whose personalities stood out. So be relaxed, enjoy it, and just talk.From Personal Experience  I clearly remember attending my first Tech Job Fair back in 2017, only because I was extremely anxious every day leading up to the event. I would go to Geekdom after class and had late nights to make sure that my website and online profiles were ready to go. Once the day came and I got there, my first thought was to run back to the car.(Image: Tenor)Three Easy StepsWhether you’re planning to attend the Tech Job Fair to find employment or to network, it’s completely normal to be a little worried about it. So here’s my advice:I can vouch for the importance of doing a little research before attending. Make sure to look at the list of companies who will be there and make a mental note of those that really interest you. You’ll be better off and more prepared to ask all the right questions.If you’re not quite sure how, “Hello, my name is…” goes a long way.This is the step that most people forget. If you find a place that you fall in love with, you need to follow up. Why wouldn’t you? That would be like falling head over heels for someone on the first date and forgetting to call. There are plenty of fish in the sea and a simple email thanking them for their time could be the reason they remember your name.Pro Tip: If you’re currently in Codeup, you can even invite them to Demo Day and have another shot at impressing them with your new skills.via GIPHYBottom LineMost importantly, STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF. Getting hired into a new company is a lot like entering a new relationship. Companies want to hire someone they can get along with everyday – someone who values their work and the company culture. Ultimately, you want to be hired by people who “get” you. It’s usually easy to tell when someone is not being genuine, so avoid pretending to be someone you’re not. Put yourself out there, smile and most of all, bring some hand-sanitizer because you’re going to be shaking a lot of hands.  —Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/6-tips-for-picking-the-best-coding-bootcamp/,6 Tips For Picking The Best Coding Bootcamp - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsHaving a tough time choosing the best coding bootcamp for you? Not sure whether the bootcamp you’ve just been admitted to is legit?Well, you’re in luck!As Codeup‘s admissions director, I speak to dozens of current and prospective students everyday. I’m here to help cut through the noise and share feedback from those students, and help you on your path to picking the best coding bootcamp for you.Program fit and quality are key to launching a successful career as a software developer, and there are six non-negotiables to keep in mind as you make your decision.We’ve all dealt with disengaged teachers, but at a good program, you shouldn’t have to. Be sure that there’s a full staff of bona fide instructors that maximize individual attention and mutual accountability.Look for three things in your programming instruction: actual work experience in the industry (not just at the bootcamp!), a passion for teaching, and access to one-on-one tutoring.College computer science courses are heavy on theory, light on useful applications. That’s great for some folks, but a good immersive coding program gives you the tools you need to get a job, and it’s best to learn from people who’ve been using them to build creations of their own. When reviewing instructors’ credentials, look past the fancy degrees and give brownie points for web development jobs and industry savvy.With that in mind, some of the most brilliant software developers simply aren’t the greatest teachers. You want to be sure your instructors love interacting with students, explaining complex concepts to beginners, and offering one-on-one help whenever needed.Also, when possible, be sure to do a campus visit and meet the instructional staff. The program staff should always be open to this.Alright, I’ll say it. Be wary of coding schools with multiple campuses. Some bootcamps are decent in one city and terrible in another. It’s much easier for a program to give you quality, individualized attention when the staff and instructors aren’t answering to people in a different time zone.There’s decades of evidence for this. The country’s best universities hunker down in one spot and focus on student success. Money-hungry diploma mills have locations in strip malls from coast-to-coast, some of which are known for high dropout rates and have been banned from recruiting military personnel. As with any decision in higher ed, choosing a focused coding bootcamp makes all the difference.You’ve probably heard people compare learning programming to learning spoken languages. There are lots of similarities, but there’s a big one to keep in mind: immersion. Both types of languages are learned best through using the language all day, every day, with other people, for an extended period of time.A coding bootcamp worth your time should provide a collaborative environment that immerses you in code. You’ll be able to sharpen your new skills alongside a team of experts and vetted fellow students. Instructors push you to the next level, and when the going gets tough, you can always ask one of your bright classmates—a whole group of bright classmates, in fact!What’s the end game of any good coding program? Getting you a well-paid job at a company you like!First, check out the schools’s job placement rate. If their admissions strategy and teaching are solid, it should be north of 90% over six months. This means they’re accepting students who will succeed as developers, not just anyone who can pay the tuition.Next, take a look at the list of companies where alumni take jobs. Are they all funneled into one industry? What’s the ratio of startups to corporations? A diverse set of post-grad placements suggests you’ll learn the programming skills necessary to succeed in any work environment.Also, make sure the school is willing to put its money where its mouth is. Good programs should guarantee you a job in a timely fashion or else give you a significant refund.Would you rather start something of your own? Even better! Keep reading below.The tech industry thrives in areas where entrepreneurs, investors, creatives, and developers—i.e., you!—can easily get together and make the magic happen.Collaborative workspaces, like Geekdom in San Antonio, allow entrepreneurs to build new business and products together. Notable local tech companies like Rackspace and top-tier startup accelerators are also key indicators of a healthy ecosystem and provide important funding sources for new ventures. Cities with diverse, technology-heavy industries (e.g., healthcare, military, energy, aeronautics, automotive, and advanced manufacturing) also offer a strong commercial base to support tech entrepreneurs and job seekers.As you start to build things, it’s also nice to be in a somewhat smaller ecosystem. Getting in on the ground floor of a growing tech scene gives you access to willing and able mentors. Smaller tech cities also tend to have lower costs of living. A new software engineer often finds it helpful to be a big fish in a friendly, easy-to-navigate pond, where the tech community’s got her back in times of success and failure.Keep an eye out for schools with various funding options. Many offer loans that allow students to defer payments until after graduation. That’s a huge plus, but you should also ask about non-profit tuition grants and scholarships. And should you not qualify for these benefits, at least you can rest assured that third parties have vetted your school and its leadership is serious increasing access to education.Immersive coding programs can get you started on an exciting new career path. That said, big life transitions aren’t easy. It’s important to find the right program, and we encourage all applicants to vet their options for how well each school teaches and accommodates their students.If you have any questions or comments about Codeup, or anything else, we’d love to hear from you!

Our home-grown scholarship programs, grant/funding partners, and excellent financing options make it straight-forward and easy. We’ve worked to make sure we have the best partners so that there are no predatory lenders or sketchy unreliable customer service experiences.We are happy to introduce you to our newest partner who can be a helpful funding resource for you. Meet Skills Fund. You’ll like them as much as we do when you see what they have to offer.Editor’s Note (March 2021): Skills Fund is now Ascent Funding! Check out our partnership page, here.Here’s what they have to say for themselves, in their own words:A PARTNERSHIP TO INVEST IN YOUR CODEUP EXPERIENCE &amp; SUCCESSSkills Fund’s goal is simple: we don’t finance students to attend crappy programs. For this reason, we work daily to build the best financing tools for leading bootcamps and their students.CHOOSE WHAT WORKS FOR YOUSelect from 3- and 5-year loans, and only pay interest while in-course. Gain the benefit of lower monthly payments during the repayment phase.  Different packages make interest rates workable for you, in terms of duration to pay back the loans and amounts disbursed. For more information on your Skills Fund loan options, please visit the Codeup Skills Fund portal.What is the advantage of financing and how can I use the money?A full cash payment can place unfavorable stress on your savings, and the high Annual Percentage Rate (APR) of a credit card can quickly increase the cost of your education. Financing enables ease of payment, with low, fixed competitive interest rates that can be paid back at anytime without penalty.  You can only use the loan to directly fund your Codeup education. The loan will be disbursed to Codeup within days of starting your course. Bootcamp funding like this makes completing the program hassle-free.Will I qualify for a Skills Fund loan or do I need a cosigner?As long as you meet the basic underwriting criteria – you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, have no recent bankruptcies and no history of loan default – you’ll most likely qualify for payment for your Codeup experience. You can (1) apply individually, and should you not be approved, you can reapply with a cosigner, or (2) initiate your loan process with a cosigner. So there you have it!  Don’t worry if these terms sound ultra-complex. We’ll walk through every step with you because that’s our DNA – high touch, high care. We are on your team!  We want funding be an easy part, because upgrading your life and developing your future are worth investing in!Interested in learning more?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/5-things-codeup-doesnt-tell-you/,5 Things Codeup Doesn’t Tell You - Codeup,"Sep 23, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsI remember during my first day of Codeup I began to doubt my ability to overcome the challenges that lay ahead. I soon learned that what I was experiencing was “impostor syndrome.” Jason Straughan, Codeup’s CEO, introduced us to this phenomenon that same day. Thanks to his kind advice I was able to identify, and overcome my doubts. Codeup shared many valuable lessons with me, but some lessons were taught through exposure outside of the Vogue building. If you decide to enroll at Codeup, you will find yourself learning many things outside the classroom. I realized through my own journey that there are things Codeup didn’t tell me. So, I’ve narrowed it down to the 5 main things I had to learn on my own as a newly placed software developer.You Need to be MultilingualYou need to be adaptable and willing to open your ears to all ideas. They say the best way to learn a different language is through practice. In most of our professional and non-professional lives, relationships will have an assigned lingo to properly cater to that relationship. Furthermore, professional groups and organizations like projectQUEST, H-E-B, and Codeup have their own kind of language. These languages are used to identify and recognize individuals of that group or organization. It is important to keep this in mind before you start ANY application process, or start working with new people.Even though I did not have a college degree, I still had an interest in developing coding skills. I understood early on in my application process that I was in control of my outcome. I assumed determination contained the key to my success, and soon found myself being referred to ProjectQUEST for financial assistance.I would have never known about ProjectQUEST if the Codeup staff had not offered this vital information. The dedication and support offered by these organizations helped me through the multiple application processes. If you plan to visit projectQUEST or Workforce Solutions to inquire about their grants, make sure you’re determined to learn their language, and earn the money. If you have the right amount of determination you can find the proper channels fueling San Antonio’s STEM ecosystem through a simple Google search. Determination is one of the common denominators all Codeup graduates share, and if you too share this similarity, check out the scholarships offered by Codeup.People want jobs, but not everyone wants to work.via GIPHYCodeup’s mission statement is the following, “At Codeup, we focus on two things: you and your success. Find a job within six months of graduation, or get 50% of your tuition returned.” Let me assure you they deliver in service,  content, and in career guidance. However, the staff cannot force you to either study the curriculum or develop programming skills for you. There are people that come ready to overcome adversity, then there are the few who expect to be fed morning tacos with a silver spoon. If you’re seriously considering Codeup, you need to prepare yourself to manage the beautiful chaos of assignments, interviews, and presentations.My high school soccer coach had a saying, “Do you think Ronaldo is going to parachute from a helicopter and score for you?” We never expected Ronaldo at our high school practices but that was our coach handing down some of his kind wisdom. He used this as a tactic to build the team up before the start of our shooting drills. Ronaldo is a world star player who plays at a professional level so what coach Ramos was really trying to say was, “Work hard if you want the goal. Don’t expect someone to come and score for you!” You need to have a sense of responsibility before embarking on your own journey and launching your career.Have a servant’s heart.Some lessons weren’t coming from a screen or projector and I considered these some of my favorite lessons because they spoke more about human character. A perfect example is when the Codeup staff noticed a need in our community and decided to share their passion for service with all San Antonians. The office staff volunteered to serve at the San Antonio Food Bank. This was one of the unspoken teachings Codeup shared with me – these amazing individuals create an environment where you can grow in skill and as a human being. Kudos to them!I will iterate once again that Codeup will not force you to do something you don’t want to do. As a newly placed member of this ecosystem and a Codeup graduate I would like to ask Codeup fellows and members of the community to ponder, “How are we contributing to the San Antonio ecosystem?” Having the heart of a servant is something Codeup can’t force you to do, but is a skill necessary to achieve self growth and development.Don’t eat the tacos!via GIPHYCodeup is geared to focus on your professional life, and not your waistline. The Codeup family loves to spoil the cohorts with food, they must know the way to a developer’s heart. The morning tacos, the pizza, and snacks should be enough to lure you into the Vogue building. I loved every bite and sip of these delicious perks. However I do have to confess I gained a few pounds during my time at Codeup. I was also on a budget so the ramen noodle isle at the Walgreens became very familiar. Now that I look back I wish I only had one slice of pizza instead of my usual three.One of the hardest parts of my Codeup journey was finding time to exercise. Taking care of myself felt impossible in this intense immersive environment, but believe me when I say “It is possible!” This was thanks to one of my colleagues, who insisted on completing daily reps of stairs up and down the Travis Park garage.I felt instant restoration after just a few days of exercise. This simple exercise routine helped me deal with stress and gave me enough time to meditate on the things that pushed me towards triumph.Don’t bite the hand that feeds you.The saying “Don’t bite the hand that feeds you” has stuck with me since I was thirteen years old, and made the dumb decision to complain about my job in front of my dad. My dad was not fond of me complaining of the man who signed my checks, so he shared a lesson behind his belligerent words. This made me realize that my ego was blocking my ability to humble myself, and that I needed to be thankful to the people that were trying to help me. His wise words taught me to stay loyal to those who become part of my upbringing.This saying has stuck with me ever since, and I decided to mark it as a special lesson. A lesson I could only acquired through experience. I realize now the same goes with any organization or relationship that we hold, professional or non professional. We should be able to acknowledge where our loyalties stand, and if we are giving the proper amount of recognition to those who have helped us.The Codeup staff did everything in their power to plug me into a bigger network of opportunities. Lastly, I was exposed to a network of genuinely loving, and caring people. These amazing benefits make me appreciate the Codeup program so much more. I walked in with the desire to learn computer programming. I am leaving with the ability and skills that say “I am a software developer!”Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/5-common-excuses-keeping-you-from-breaking-into-the-tech-field/,5 Common Excuses Keeping You From Breaking Into the Tech Field - Codeup,"Apr 26, 2019 | Tips for Prospective StudentsJust a few months before starting at Codeup in the Redwood cohort, I was sitting in the football stadium at the University of Colorado at Boulder, pondering what I would do after graduation. The commencement speaker that year was Kate Fagan, a sports reporter and commentator at ESPN. In her speech, something she said stuck out to me: “Try replacing ‘should’ with ‘want’ and, as frequently as you are able, make decisions with that rubric. Life is best when your ‘should’ and your ‘want’ are aligned.” Sitting there in that stadium, I realized that I knew exactly what I should be doing after graduating, which was applying to attend graduate school for the next five years. But the actual truth was, I didn’t know what I truly wanted. Did I really want to jump into something for five years that I wasn’t completely sure about?With this in mind I moved to San Antonio after graduation, mostly to be closer to my family. One night at the dinner table, my brother-in-law mentioned several eye-catching billboards around town promoting a local coding bootcamp named Codeup. I had dabbled a bit in coding when I was in college, so my interest was immediately piqued. However, there were doubts nagging at the back of my mind. Am I even capable enough to attend an intensive coding bootcamp like this? I’m not really a super logical person… Am I cut out for this? etc, etc. Despite having a ton of reservations about my capabilities and the usefulness of attending a boot camp, I decided to take a leap of faith. And just a year-and-a-half later, I celebrated my one year as a software developer at Armor in Richardson, TX. In some ways, it feels like a dream. The hard work I put in, the days and nights of impassioned coding, pushing through all the excuses… and finally landing a dream job?! It’s a colorful blur.So that’s why in this post, I want to address five common excuses that may be keeping you from considering a career in technology. At the end of the day, it doesn’t really make sense to let your fears and nagging doubts keep you from the job of your dreams.This was one of the primary fears at the forefront of my mind when thinking about doing a complete shift to a technology career. And, as I went through Codeup, I heard this many times from my peers. To be honest, it doesn’t ever fully go away. There are days even now at work where I think I’m in over my head and that I don’t belong there (Imposter Syndrome, anyone?). This fear completely disregards the fact that I’m already doing it. The truth is, it isn’t always easy. Technology is constantly changing, creating new problems and forcing those within the field to continuously find new solutions. At my company, even our most senior developers are learning something new every day. We all have our doubts sometimes, but those self-limiting beliefs shouldn’t keep you from pursuing anything you set your mind to.Let me ask you something. What does a veteran, electrical technician, and college music teacher have in common? Well, there was at least one of each in my cohort at Codeup, and all of them excelled and went on to become software developers. Other characters in my cohort included a stay-at-home-mom, barista, marketing professional, and a chef. All of these, however, are just arbitrary labels. None of these people told themselves “I’m just going to be a barista forever, because that’s who I am” or “My personality only suits being in a teacher, so I’m not going to try something different.” The reality is, our self-concept is always constantly shifting. There was such a colorful diversity of backgrounds, personalities, and skill sets at Codeup, proving that there’s no one type or mold of individual that can pursue a technology career.There are days where indeed this is the case for me, just “heads down coding”, but more often than not my days are filled with collaboration and communication with my teammates. When someone runs into a problem they don’t have the knowledge to solve, they track down someone who does. When a few of us are working in the same codebase, we make sure to frequently communicate to make sure we’re not stepping on each other’s toes. On top of that, we get to be a part of producing the product, providing feedback and suggestions. There are very few days where I just sit at my desk all day, boring holes into my computer screen. Although my experience may certainly be atypical, the main point I’m trying to make is that there is a large range of positions and cultures within the technology field. There are also other roles within the technology field beyond coding and data analytics, such as evangelists and solutions consultants. Both of these have lots of interaction with people and clients! Don’t be afraid to try a few different things until you find your fit.Most of us at Codeup did not come in with prior experience in coding. The great thing about coding bootcamps is that they typically take you from 0 to 100 in a condensed period of time. They guide you through the entire process, allowing you to maximize your success, with everything from technical skills, networking, portfolio-building, and resume review. Even with bootcamps aside, there is a plethora of both paid and free resources online that give you the ability to learn a lot of the preliminary skills you would need. There are communities (e.g. Chingu) with the sole purpose of learning and building projects in new technologies. Experience can be gained, so seek out those resources. They’re only a few keystrokes away. One thing to note about the technology field is that it’s becoming more and more heavily based on experience and not your formal education. Many companies will see the value in someone who has practical experience. The reality is that many companies are shifting towards seeking out individuals that can come in and hit the ground running with practical know-how instead of purely theoretical education.Although basic computer skills are necessary for success, it’s probably not as much as you think. And like I mentioned above, being able to excel in this field is all about embracing change and learning to learn. You may think you’re not tech savvy because you always have issues with your radio or you can’t get your apps to work right or you get frustrated with your computer software for not doing what you want it to – all of these things are valid struggles. Trust me, I’ve been there. The reality is this: Many of these skills can be learned.As you look into pursuing a career in the technology field, don’t let these thought patterns keep you from getting where you want to be. Instead, ask yourself the real questions: Why do I want to do this? What kind of lifestyle do I see for myself? What am I passionate about? Excuses are excuses, not truths about you and your life. Set a vision and relentlessly pursue it, letting all these limiting beliefs slide off of you. They don’t have to define your journey.Joyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

Today’s blog is here to break down financial aid and tuition funding for bootcamps.First off, if you want to attend a bootcamp, there are a lot of ways to make it work financially.

https://www.tpr.org/technology-entrepreneurship/2021-04-16/codeup-buys-rackspace-cloud-academy,San Antonio-Based Codeup Buys Rackspace Cloud Academy | TPR,"Codeup, the San Antonio-based, boot-camp style technology training program, purchased the Rackspace Cloud Academy from Rackspace Technology Friday.The purchase increases Codeup’s size in the city, the number of students it can graduate each year, and the variety of training programs and certifications the school can offer.“I think that since the day we opened Codeup, we have looked at the Open Cloud Academy with a tremendous amount of respect,” said Jason Straughan, co-founder and CEO. “We’re happy that all of these years later we’re gonna be able to come under one roof.”In recent years, Codeup expanded its in-person training to Dallas. It also has offices in Houston and Austin, offering online training programs in those cities. The Cloud Academy (now called the Codeup Cloud Academy) will expand the school into Rackspace’s windcrest headquarters. The deal comes with a lease of the Cloud Academy’s facility there.It will add 80 percent more classroom space for Codeup across the state and double it locally. Straughan said it might be the most exciting thing they’ve done since they were founded, and it should help achieve their main goal.“We have a ten year goal to be the number one place in Texas to enter a career in technology,” he explained.The current plan is to continue the cloud academy’s offerings unabated. The purchase marries the systems administration and the cyber security curriculum of the cloud academy with the web development and data science programs of Codeup. The two organizations in the past have shared that goal, to fill desperately needed technology roles across the state.That’s how the two different programs were born within a year of each other. Codeup was founded in 2014 by Straughan, Michael Girdley, and Chris Turner — trying to fill open stack web developer positions their companies had. The Open Cloud Academy was founded the year before by Rackspace to fill the rapidly growing company’s positions.""Codeup merging with Rackspace Cloud will make them even more compelling to San Antonians (who want) to enter tech careers,"" said Graham Weston in a text. Weston, the former CEO of Rackspace, said that the Cloud Academy has changed lives.Like Codeup, the main selling point is an education that can net them a high(er) paying gig.In the early days of the Cloud Academy, when they were still in the Weston Center downtown, then director Deborah Carter says they had ordered pizza for the classes. The pizza delivery guy inquired about the program and would join a later training course.“Then many years later after he got a job, he sent me an email saying he had bought his first house,” she said.Carter credits Weston for his vision.“I am really excited that OCA (Open Cloud Academy) is going to continue to thrive with local leadership,” she said.The future of the Cloud Academy has been anything but certain over the years. The school was first started as a way to fill the hyperspeed growth at Rackspace. But that growth fell off. Carter said they always anticipated having to pivot other employers, and successfully did so.But in 2016 Rackspace sold to private equity giant Apollo Global Management.In arrangements like that, it isn’t unreasonable to see non-core functions cut. But while the company saw lean times, cutting as much as six percent of its staff, the school continued largely unaffected in downtown. The question always present: Would the Cloud Academy be part of Rackspace long-term?Rackspace has gone through a number of changes and pivots to everything from leadership to ownership — the company went public again last August. The Open Cloud Academy remained, and was even invested in.Rackspace renamed it the Rackspace Cloud Academy last June, expanded its training, and gave it a new home in the Windcrest corporate headquarters.Rackspace Technology was not immediately available for comment. Now, the two companies and training programs are one. The acquisition pushes Codeup’s total graduate numbers up around 30% per year.The jobs remain in demand with cyber security positions growing by 31%, according to the bureau of labor statistics.

https://therivardreport.com/codeup-set-to-open-coding-school-in-dallas/,Codeup Set to Open Coding School in Dallas,"San Antonio ReportCodeup, a homegrown career school for aspiring software developers, is expanding to Dallas.The Houston Street immersive coding school for adults is taking its web development program to the Big D with plans to open a downtown Dallas campus in early 2020, CEO Jason Straughan told the Rivard Report Friday.The company announced in a blog post its intentions to launch in Dallas to serve a growing need for tech workers in the Dallas-Forth Worth metropolitan area. Pending approval from the Texas Workforce Commission, which regulates career schools and colleges in the state, Codeup is set to open in Dallas with an initial cohort of 24 students studying full-stack web development, which includes programming the design and behavior of a website as well as the underlying data and backbone of a website.As Straughan and the team at Codeup contemplated a potential expansion beyond state lines, the need to grow within it became clear, he said.“When you start looking at the needs of tech workers in Texas, it is just unbelievable and continues to grow,” he said. “Roughly 42 percent of all tech jobs are in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area.”The sheer demand in the DFW area has become increasingly apparent to Codeup as it has placed a tenth of its graduates in jobs there over the past year and a half, Straughan said. Despite being five hours away from San Antonio by car, Dallas remains within close enough proximity to the other four major cities in Texas that Codeup sees its new school in that city as an extension of the San Antonio campus, Straughan said.“If we were to go to Tampa, or if we had gone to Norfolk or gone to Kansas City, you’re officially opening a second Codeup,” he said. “But by staying in Texas and opening a campus in Dallas, we’re really just extending, we think, our San Antonio offering to another city.”Codeup has taken a different tack to growth than many of its national peers in the coding school space. Whereas contemporaries such as The Iron Yard and Dev Bootcamp focused their business on aggressive expansion in top tech markets, and subsequently shut down, Straughan said Codeup has chosen to hold off on expanding its footprint for the first seven years.After launching a data science boot camp this year, and growing its Downtown San Antonio space, Codeup set its sights on expanding outside of the city. Adding more classes and programming too quickly in San Antonio would have oversaturated the market, Straughan said.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Codeup has signed a lease at the historic Katy Building in Downtown Dallas, located at 701 Commerce St., and expects the Texas Workforce Commission to decide whether to approve the new school within the next few months.Nearly 100 students enrolled in Codeup’s most popular offering, a 20-week full-time program focused on web design and development, between September 2016 and August 2017, the most recent report published on the Texas Workforce Commission’s website. Just over 80 percent of those enrolled completed the 600-hour, $27,500 program, and close to three-quarters of them found related employment after graduating, according to the commission.",[],[],[],[],True

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/my-codeup-experience-mario-m/,My Codeup Experience: Mario M. - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Alumni StoriesEvery now and again, we will be posting blogs written by our students. These blogs will be ranging from their experience in the program, why they are doing the program, and what they hope to do afterward. We want our students to express themselves and be heard, letting people know what it the program is like from a primary source and give people insight as to why someone would want to put themselves through a high stress, immersive programming bootcamp.Our first student blog is from Mario M.:When one thinks of boot camp, the first thing that comes to mind is shaved heads, tons of work packed into every second of the day, quick meals, and dark circles under the eyes from a lack of sleep. Now, I’ve been through Marine Corps boot camp, and while there’s been no shaving of heads here at Codeup (yet!), the rest has held true so far, at least for me.Just like actual boot camp, this has been no walk in the park. As a noob web developer, my first week at Codeup can only be equated to a non-swimmer being thrown into the deep end of the pool with no water wings or foam noodle to hold on to, who upon flailing and splashing his way to the edge of the pool discovers that his trunks have fallen off and sunk to the bottom of the pool. Talk about immersion!The lessons have come fast and furious, each building upon the other. I have to admit: I have fallen behind at times. Learning how to navigate a Mac at the same time as learning how to code has not been fun! “How do I switch applications?” “I created a file but now I can’t find it!” “Command L or Command TAB?” “This is taking me forever to type everything out longhand! How is everyone finishing so damn quickly!!? Oh, you mean I can just hit the up arrow?” “What does full stack mean? This is not IHOP! I am hungry though! Pancakes sound good right about now??” Note to self: keep your internal dialogue to yourself, Mario.Moving on to the coursework. So far, we’ve been learning PHP and working with command lines. Even with the pre-work that we were assigned before class started, I was and still am at times completely lost. Thankfully, the instructors and TA’s have a lot of patience in explaining the concepts. Little by little, the knowledge is beginning to sink in. Some days are better than others, but I can slowly see the progression.I think I am just a bit hard on myself, being a perfectionist and all. Normally, I am a quick learner, which is why I’ve gotten even more frustrated with my lack of progression. As someone who is still unfamiliar with coding terminology, even asking a question can be a chore. I imagined hearing this quote from the movie “I, Robot” as an instructor’s response to me trying to verbalize my question: “I’m sorry, my responses are limited. You must ask the right questions.”To expand on that in a more serious manner, the instructors won’t just GIVE you the solution. They will lead you in the right direction, but you have to put in the work by reading the PHP manual, reviewing the previous modules, or using my friend Google. That being said, class time is devoted to reviewing the previous modules, which gives us all a chance to look over our work and discover any mistakes we made. The cohorts also try to help each other out when they can. As the class progresses, I hope that I am more capable to offer help than I am at this point.Looking at the big picture, I have learned a lot in a short amount of time. We all have. The instructors keep harping on the fact that we know more in one week than some web devs learned in their first year. Hard to imagine, yes, but it’s not just something said to raise our spirits. Other seasoned web devs have said the same thing to us, as well.There seems to be quite a buzz around Codeup, which is very encouraging. We’ve already had several guest speakers, among them city councilman Diego Bernal, and each of them seemed genuinely enthusiastic about Codeup. More people in the Geekdom community seem to want to get involved and see that we succeed. Everyone is very positive and excited, and the fact that this is taking place of San Antonio bodes well for the community going forward.So next up for us is HTML and CSS. I hope I pick it up quicker than I did PHP. I may not see the light at the end of the tunnel yet, but I know it will be rapidly approaching!Mario M. is a Web Dev noob, former Marine, certified personal trainer, Arsenal FC fan, long-suffering New York Knicks fan, lover of all things hard rock and heavy metal, and an avid reader.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/student-blog-sharon-r-a-leap-of-logic/,"Student Blog: Sharon R. ""A Leap of Logic"" - Codeup","Aug 14, 2018 | Alumni StoriesA Leap of Logic: A Blog by Sharon R.“Leaps” are not new to me.I ended my “formal” schooling in Seguin just under 30 years ago, and I find it interesting that it took coming back to San Antonio to finally take control of my future.Majoring in accounting in a liberal arts university, I was exposed to programming via required classes in COBOL and BASIC. That was my last exposure to programming, but computers always stayed part of my professional life. I found that I enjoyed figuring out new software and developing a user-end expertise in whatever programs I was required to use.I began using my degree after graduation, moving up in the accounting world in smaller, privately held companies until taking a position with Texaco in 1990. Once there, it didn’t take very long to move into the overseas marketing department. Shortly after that, I found myself in El Salvador, then Honduras, New York, and finally the Dominican Republic.After 8 years overseas, I was tired of the constant moves and wanted to expand beyond gas stations and convenience stores, so I was looking forward to new adventures and moving back to the States when Texaco was purchased. However, I was too long out of accounting to go back and too long out of the States to easily find something outside of my experience.Once again, I changed direction, finally ending up in the merchandising industry out of Houston where I spent most of the past 10 years. Although a booming industry, it is somewhat risky for management as contracts shift and change (or are canceled) on a regular basis.Three years ago, I was courted by my latest employer when one of the clients moved to them, and I became an Account Manager overseeing that client. A year ago, the company transferred me to San Antonio.And then the company declared it was financially ruined due to the nature of its core business – book and magazine distribution. It was purchased by another this past October, days before closing its doors. I was hired by the new company, but it also announced it was having financial difficulties.So, after many leaps into new industries, countries, cities, etc., I found myself once again looking for a path. This time, however, I wanted the leap to be logical and one in which I could find stability and fulfillment.Just days after knowing I had to change again, I heard someone from Codeup speaking on Texas Public Radio. I wrote down the name and started my research. Three months later, after looking into the industry, I quit my job and started a new life as a web developer by becoming a student at Codeup.I’ve made so many leaps in my life but never before had I made a leap of logic. In the past, my leaps were made because someone else said I had to or should do something. This time, it’s because it is the logical thing to do.I was terrified of the unknown each time I made a change, but as I sit in this classroom with only 3 more weeks to go to complete the Codeup course, I become more and more confident that this is exactly where I am supposed to be. The entire world is moving more towards computers and web applications, and I am right on top of that wave.Sharon was born in California but spent most of her childhood in Miami. She graduated from Texas Lutheran University after majoring in accounting and then moved back to Miami.She was with the Latin American/West Africa/Caribbean group of Texaco for 12 years, 8 of those in international positions throughout Central America and the Caribbean.She returned to the States in 1990, leaving Texaco and landing in Houston. She moved to San Antonio a year ago when the company she worked for offered her a promotion.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/my-experience-at-codeup-mario-m-2/,My Experience at Codeup: Mario M. #2 - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Alumni StoriesPreviously in the blog, I discussed my first few weeks in Codeup, the accelerated web development bootcamp I have been attending. Well, a few more weeks have passed since then, and I think it would be appropriate now to discuss my reasons for attending the course in the first place.I have always been a creative person, and since I can remember I’ve been looking for ways to express my creativity. I grew up reading tons of books, comics, and magazines. I also loved drawing, playing video games and solving puzzles.When I was a kid, my dad used to have a pile of these old Atari magazines, and each issue had these short coding programs, written in BASIC if I’m not mistaken. If you typed in all the code correctly, a dinky little game would run. Nothing compared to X-Box or Playstation, but at the time, though, I thought it was pretty awesome!The past few years, personally and professionally, I’ve gotten away from being the creative person I once was. So, I guess you could say that by joining the Codeup program, I’ve come full circle. Except now, I am the one writing the code, not copying it from the back of Atari magazines, and the apps I’ll eventually be able to create will put those old BASIC games to shame.Well enough about me, back to the class. We have moved away from working in the command line, which is what we did the majority of the first few weeks with PHP.  We are now working in the browser writing basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Putting together all we know, we have been able to create working apps and games. Pretty cool for someone who knew nothing about code a month ago!The things I’ve created so far are pretty basic when compared to the advanced work of some of my fellow cohorts. It’s like those cake memes you see on Facebook comparing baking expectations with reality. My code is more like the deformed blob of a Minion cake than something you would see on Cake Boss. Definitely not something you want to bring to a child’s birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese unless you want to make them cry.I kid, but honestly the learning curve has remained steep, at least for me. I’ve always been the kind of student who picked things up quickly, finished his work early, and then read ahead or did extra credit work while my peers struggled to catch up. Now, I am one of the last ones to finish an exercise, and that is a bit humbling to say the least.At times there are moments of clarity, where the hazy fog over my brain slowly lifts, and I fully understand an exercise, and I have that “a-ha!” moment. Other times, not so much. The instructors are great, though, in reviewing each exercise and seeking to provide as much clarity as possible. However, since this is an accelerated web development course, we can only spend so much time on one subject before we have to move on to the next exercise.That being said, there is plenty of opportunity for study hall. Junior instructors will stay a few hours after class and even make themselves available on the weekends to help us or clarify problem areas. I strongly encourage future cohorts to take advantage of these times as much as possible, and ask plenty of questions. Also, keep writing code. Not just to understand the logic, but also to become accustomed to how code looks stylistically. There are certain conventions that must be followed regarding code format.One last thing to keep in mind, as difficult as it may seem at times, coding is just stringing together a bunch of simple functions, which eventually become an intricate framework of simple ideas. As such, simplicity and, even more important, readability is key.At some point in the future, someone else will have to read your code. If it is hard to follow or read, they are going to shake their fists in the air and curse your first-born child! Six months from now, YOU may be the one reading your old code. So, keep it simple. Remember to be kind to your future self!I sincerely hope to see some of you all in one of the upcoming classes this year! In the meantime, read all you can about web development, and Always Be Coding!Mario M. is a Web Dev noob, former Marine, certified personal trainer, Arsenal FC fan, long-suffering New York Knicks fan, lover of all things hard rock and heavy metal, and an avid reader.

She explained that she had dabbled in computer programming some but like most other students failed to find the proper instruction needed to be proficient in the technologies.“Applying for and being accepted as a Codeup student meant making a full commitment to my goals in becoming an excellent programmer and making an investment in myself to do so in a challenging, rewarding 9-week time span.”Our program requires a full-time commitment during these 9-weeks but all for the reason that we want to make sure you get your money’s worth. Leslie admitted that she was most excited about being in a collaborative environment with hands-on learning and instruction from the experienced teachers and motivated peers.“Bringing people together from different backgrounds to learn and explore the possibilities of programming is much more stimulating than most traditional education approaches.”After completing the class, Leslie hopes to enter the male-dominated programming field with confidence. Short term, Leslie plans to apply her knowledge to create the high quality products that positively impact us on a daily basis. Looking even further down the road she confesses, “I want to inspire others to join the tech community and build awesome things with me!”We’re lucky to have her on board!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://tribucodeup.wpengine.com/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/,What is a Full Stack Developer? - Codeup Web Development,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentWritten by Hannah WestbergWe have talked before about different types of programmers, but we have yet to touch on the elusive “ full stack developer. ” Varying definitions of this title exist: from a developer specialized in everything from front-end to back-end; to a developer who has a general knowledge in all steps from concept to finished product; to a fictional figure with a virtually unattainable skill set.Full stack die-hards would consider a full stack developer to have specialized knowledge in all stages of software development. Thus, they would be proficient, if not fluent, in:Is this possible in Web 2.0? Naysayers argue that with the increasingly diverse aspects of web development, it’s virtually impossible to be a true full stack developer. Frankly, it may not even be practical to do so.Others are of the opinion that a full stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren’t experts at everything; they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. Such gurus make building software much easier as they understand how everything works from top to bottom and can anticipate problems accordingly. In our opinion, this is the most realistic definition of a full stack developer.Often times,  this class of developers stems from start-up environments, where a vast knowledge of all facets of web development is essential for a business’ survival.Clearly, it takes years of work experience in different languages, roles, and industries to reach this level of qualification. Because of this, full stack developers are few and far between, making those who exist very employable and in-demand.Interested in becoming a full stack developer?

https://codeup.com/web-development/why-colleges-suck-at-making-programmers/,Why Colleges Suck at Making Programmers - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective StudentsWhen creating Codeup, we went out and talked to lots of people in the tech industry both on the employer and employee side. One thing became very clear: colleges are doing a terrible job producing programmers.Here’s what we found out:Programming isn’t fun  Undergrad computer science has changed little since the late 1990s when I was in school. One thing that hasn’t changed is the high weed-out rate of students in CS. According to a study out of the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland, between 30 and 50% of CS majors drop out and switch to other majors during their first intro to CS course. The number one reason: lack of motivation. Colleges don’t make CS fun, and that’s a tragedy.College takes a long timeMany people went back to school hoping to become developers.  In the case of an associate’s program, it take 2 years or more. A classic college education is four years. You do not want to know about how much it costs (click here to find out).College includes things that aren’t necessary to do a programming jobDoes one really need a full liberal arts degree with electives to be employable? As the recent crops of college graduates have demonstrated, a college degree doesn’t mean a future.Lectures are a terrible way to learn codingThink of programming like learning a new spoken language. Is that best done sitting in classroom or being on the streets of a foreign country talking with the locals? The same thing goes for college where the lecture format still dominates.Colleges teach what they can sellColleges sell degrees, not futures.  If a college had to guarantee a future to its graduates, would they offer so many degrees that produce people with no useful skills?Professors (often) teach what interests themFor those of us who took a class from a research professor, we discovered quickly that our semester long class would be 20% quickly going through course materials and an 80% deep dive on the professor’s personal research interests. It’s great that the professor thinks that pandas are a majestic animal, but the class is Biology, not endangered species 101.College is slow to keep upIn tech, things move incredibly fast. Here’s the problem with college development: departments start planning their offerings several years before the student is taught the information. By that time, it’s likely the real world has changed so much that the student is being taught information from 3 or 4 years ago. In visiting some CS departments, I have heard from students that their professors were teaching languages that went out of real-world usage decades ago.So, STEM education is broken. Schools need to align their interests with those of the students. Schools need to make tech accessible. Schools need to put students first, rather than treat them as customers. Students should finish with a future and not a mountain of debt. And so on. Things need to change.We think there’s a better answer, and we’ve designed it. If schools sold you an education but not a future, we have the answer.

https://codeup.com/web-development/what-is-a-web-designer/,What is a Web Designer? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentThe big world of computer programming contains many roles that need to cooperate for everything to work. Think of “computer programming” as an umbrella term for many different types of people doing different but complementary things. Today, we will discuss the meaning of a web designer, a term used in the computer programming field.We will be begin with what we see when we look at a web page: the design.A web designer handles the way a web page looks. When users access a web page, the ease with which they find necessary information determines the quality of the user experience. If the website looks ugly or feels difficult to navigate, users probably won’t return to the website. Some examples of the technologies web designers will use include HTML5, CSS3, PHP, Flash, and JavaScript.This list outlines things that web designers have to keep in mind when deciding how to design a website:Marketing and communicationHow can we define the target group and what works with them? A web designer must consider these questions, among others, when thinking about the design of the website. For example, if we consider culture as a factor for a target group, look at the Korean website G-Market and the American website Amazon. Many websites in the Asian market contain cluttered graphics that constantly try to get your attention. However, in the North American market, Amazon treats its customers differently. They only offer what consumers find interesting based on their browsing history. Designers must understand their audience and how best to communicate with them before diving into the design of the website.User experience Without appropriate labeling and an understanding of how the website works, a user cannot gain any useful information from a website. Depending on a user’s level of computer literacy, having a difficult user experience will prevent that user from using the website ever again. Great user experience allows users to gain the most from a website at any given time.In terms of user interactivity, the complexity depends on what needs to be relayed to the user. For example, if the website gives users directions to a specific location, then an interactive map would help to have. However, if the website has a more complicated purpose, then the interactivity becomes an even larger issue that must be address in design. Overall, user experience and interactivity should encourage users to continue coming back to the website.LayoutLayout basically means the skeleton of the page, and deals with things like pixel width, alignment, grids, and others. Should all of the pages in the website have the same basic layout, or should it all be different? Aesthetically, we can appreciate it more easily if it is all consistent, but sometimes page layout has to be changed. Consider layout as the foundation and frame of the website design; everything else gets built within its parameters.TypographySerif? Sans serif? The types of typefaces and type styles strongly influence the way a website looks and how users interpret it. We should also note that you never want to use Comics Sans. Never, ever use Comic Sans.GraphicsGraphics are pictures that are on the website. The designer has to decide where it is best to put them if there is also text. However, if graphics are the highlighted feature of any said website, then they have to have precedence over text. Look at Pinterest and compare it to Facebook. Photos take precedence on Pinterest whereas with Facebook, it has much less precedence.SalaryNow, for the big question: how much do web designers make? According to Salary.com, web designers make between $45,000 to $83,000 a year.Do you think you’d like to do this job,, but don’t have the skills necessary to do it?

https://codeup.com/web-development/7-signs-you-should-do-a-programming-bootcamp/,7 Signs You Should do a Programming Bootcamp - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective Students There is little wonder why the tech industry is booming; computers are everywhere, and developers are frantically writing code to make them work for us. There are plenty of tech jobs out there for people to get, but not everyone has the skills necessary to be successful in the tech industry. Where are the best places to learn those skills? Programming bootcamps, of course! But before you click the apply button (right here), make sure that you fit these 7 signs you should do a programming bootcamp. You are bored at work; you stopped caring about meeting quotas ages ago; you are jealous of other people in different industries. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life doing something you dislike, working with people you hate, and earning a salary that grows slower than inflation? You need a career change, and a programming bootcamp can you get you into a career faster than going to a 4-year university or getting an expensive master degree.Computers fascinate you. You have always wondered how they work; you use them every day, and you are always wondering, “How did they make it work so well for me?” You always know what apps to download and how to use productivity software. You need to understand how the technology works to start building new apps.Finding out about new things gets you excited. You love sharing your new knowledge with others, and you are excited when you can implement new knowledge into something. Learning how to program is a lifetime learning experience. You will more than likely learn new languages as time goes on and technologies improve. Once you understand the basics of programming, picking up a new language is simple. What is even better is that the learning that you do can directly translate to making more money.You see something wrong, and you have a strong inclination to fix it. There are things out there that make you mad, and you want to see them changed. You are the type of person who always says, “Yeah, but it can be done better” then you need to be a programmer. You can solve real world problems and make life more efficient for thousands if not millions of people. All it takes is the skills to build a software solution to solve a problem and a problem that makes you angry. Get mad, get solving.You work long hours, and no one seems to care; You feel like people dismiss you because you are “lower level,” and you want to be heard because you have ideas that can help others at work, but no one wants to give you a chance to speak. A lot of us have been there. As a developer, you are the one pulling the strings; you design the software, build it, and then implement it in the way you see fit. If something does not work out, you can fix it immediately because you understand coding and how computers work. People will value you for your skill set because not everyone knows how to build software. The community itself is always willing to listen to new ideas because we all depend on each other to build tools and help each other out move to the next level.Ideas are the same as mouths; Everyone has one, and they can be big or small, depending on who you are and how much you love to talk. The difference between people who have a great idea and the people to execute on their ideas is the gumption to execute. If you have ideas you think people will want to buy in to, then there is no reason why you could not start a company and begin to work for yourself. You can also work as a freelance developer charge a high hourly rate. Consulting? You can do that, too! All it takes is the skills you learn from a programming bootcamp.At the very least, you are the type of person who is happy when you see someone enjoy something you have built. Whether it is a bird feeder, a house, an event, a dress, or a nice dinner, you develop a great sense of pride when you see people use or enjoy something you have created. Being a programmer is the same thing; you can build software that people can use, and in many ways, it cane make their lives better.Just a reminder, that button you should click to apply for a programming bootcamp is right here. If you fit these 7 signs, I think it is high-time for you to click it.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/web-development/front-end-vs-back-end/,Front-end vs Back-end - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web Development, Tips for Prospective StudentsWe can differentiate between front-end and back-end development easily by understanding that web designers focus on the design, typography, colors, etc. (front-end development), while web programmers focus on back-end development using specific languages (MySQL, PHP, other database languages, etc). Front-end = what you see; back-end = how it works.These days, front-end development refers to the part of the web users interact with. In the past, web development consisted of people who worked with Photoshop and those who could code HTML and CSS. Now, developers need a handle of programs like Photoshop and coding in not only in HTML and CSS, but also JavaScript or jQuery (a compiled library of JavaScript).Websites combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, all controlled by the browser. For example, if you use Google Chrome or Firefox, the browser translates all of the code in a manner for you to see and interact with, such as fonts, colors, drop-down menus, sliders, forms, etc. In order for all of this to work, though, something has to support the front-end; here the backend comes into play.In a previous blog, we talked about how web programmers are concerned with launching websites, updates, and maintenance, among other things. All of that works to support the front-end of the website. The back-end has three parts to it: server, application, and database.To better explain, let’s use the example of a customer trying to purchase a plane ticket using a website. Everything that the customer sees on the webpage is the front-end. However, once the customer enters all of their information (ie. their name, billing address, destination, etc), the web application stores the information in a database that was created previously on the server where the website is calling for information.The web application creates, deletes, changes, renames, etc items in the database. For example, when a customer purchases a ticket, that creates an item in the database, but when they change their order or they wish to cancel, they change the item in the database.A server, in the simplest form, is a computer accessed remotely that runs software to fulfill requests from clients. In our example, the server the customer’s browser is communicating with is where the database is stored and modified.When a customer wants to buy a ticket, the backend operation web application communicates with the server to make a change in a database stored on said server. Backend programmers use technologies like Java, PHP, Ruby, Python, and others to make this communication work smoothly, allowing the customer to purchase his or her ticket with ease.Many of these technologies relate to eachother. They all work together to make something work. Some developers can program for both front-end and back-end. However, it takes much more time to design while programming the back-end. It all depends on the project and what technologies and skills are needed where.Which do you prefer? Does front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interest you more? Or do you see yourself as a back-end champion tackling technologies like PHP, Python, and Ruby? Whichever your choice, you can learn how to use these programming languages in Codeup. Our classes focus on Java and client-side JavaScript; This leaves room for our graduates to decide whether they would like to pursue front-end or back-end development.For the next blog, we will talk about being a full stack developer and what that entails.Interested in learning in becoming a software developer?

https://codeup.com/web-development/learning-to-code-vs-learning-to-build/,Learning to Code vs Learning to Build - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentIn creating Codeup, we interviewed a lot of people, and we discovered an ugly truth: there are tons of ways out there to learn to code. However, there are few that would teach you how to apply your newfound knowledge. People would tell us: “I went through Codeacademy or a CS program at college and I can’t make anything.”As we talked to employers, we confirmed this ugly truth: tons of people can “code” but few can actually build anything. Why, we asked, do employers only want to hire people with 3+ years experience? That’s because classical education opportunities are clearly not teaching people how to build real stuff.So, for Codeup, we built a program designed not to teach people “how to code” but instead “how to build.” At each stage of the course, the emphasis is on building stuff: a blog using framework, a jQuery game, command line applications, and then a Capstone Project that is representative of a real-world, production application.If you want to be employable, learn to build stuff using code.

https://codeup.com/web-development/what-is-a-full-stack-developer/,What is a Full Stack Developer? - Codeup Web Development,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentWritten by Hannah WestbergWe have talked before about different types of programmers, but we have yet to touch on the elusive “ full stack developer. ” Varying definitions of this title exist: from a developer specialized in everything from front-end to back-end; to a developer who has a general knowledge in all steps from concept to finished product; to a fictional figure with a virtually unattainable skill set.Full stack die-hards would consider a full stack developer to have specialized knowledge in all stages of software development. Thus, they would be proficient, if not fluent, in:Is this possible in Web 2.0? Naysayers argue that with the increasingly diverse aspects of web development, it’s virtually impossible to be a true full stack developer. Frankly, it may not even be practical to do so.Others are of the opinion that a full stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren’t experts at everything; they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. Such gurus make building software much easier as they understand how everything works from top to bottom and can anticipate problems accordingly. In our opinion, this is the most realistic definition of a full stack developer.Often times,  this class of developers stems from start-up environments, where a vast knowledge of all facets of web development is essential for a business’ survival.Clearly, it takes years of work experience in different languages, roles, and industries to reach this level of qualification. Because of this, full stack developers are few and far between, making those who exist very employable and in-demand.Interested in becoming a full stack developer?

https://codeup.com/web-development/what-are-web-programmers/,What are Web Programmers? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentContinuing with our series of the different types of computer programmers out there, we will be discussing what a web programmer does. They often work closely with web designers who are mostly responsible for making websites look aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, depending on the audience. Simply put, web programmers are responsible for how the website works.Websites are not things that people can build and just leave on the Internet and expect great results. As things change over time, such as company growth and diversification of products and services, websites need to be maintenanced and updated. In order to do so, programmers must know a variety of programming languages, such as C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, Python, HTML, and CSS, in order to build websites more completely and build apps within the websites.Launching websitesWhen web apps are built for different platforms, it is up to web programmers to make sure that the launch of the application goes smoothly. An example of a website launch gone awry at launch time would be healthcare.gov. When the site was launched last year, the site did not work as it had been advertised for many people, becoming an embarrassment for the federal government. The website was rushed in order to meet a specific deadline. Launching websites takes a lot of time and a team of people to make sure that the website meets all of the criteria set form by the team or company and works properly as a version 1.0. Websites can always be updated later, but the first version of the website has to be stable and working for as many users as possible, unless companies are interested in having another failure like the health care website.UpdatesWeb programmers are responsible for updating websites with new apps and features in order to keep up with changes in the business landscape. Web programmers have to query users to gain insight on additional application requirements for web apps. This way, they can figure out what specifications they need in order to build apps that will work with what software and hardware people are using. For example, recently, Google had made it a requirement if people wanted a YouTube account, it would be directly connected to Google+. This was a huge change to the website and the way people login and manage their channels on YouTube, and there were problems, but in the end, it has been working and updated with bug fixes to keep it running smoothly, which is another responsibility for web programmers.MaintenanceImagine if high traffic websites, like Facebook, Google, and YouTube, were not kept up and never updated. They would fail immensely and never amount to anything. People would leave and go someplace else that is properly maintained. Web programmers need to maintain websites to make sure they are functioning well. Coding is very difficult, and ideas on paper may not work in the real world, so programmers have to go back into the code, debug it, test it, and continue this process until they are able to make stable changes to websites. This is also why when you see major updates for websites, they are few and far between. Smaller updates take less time and are meant for maintenance.SalaryWeb programmers can make between $40,000 – $80,000 per year, depending on experience and level of work. Some can make much more than that, depending on who they work for and what they are doing. Salaries are expected to go up in the future, so learning how to code now and programming websites are good strategies to start a new life in a new career.Now that we talked about web designers and web programmers, we can talk about the different jobs of web programmers, differentiated in two categories: front-end and back-end.

https://codeup.com/web-development/5-tools-every-programmer-should-use/,5 Tools Every Programmer Should Use - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentEvery trade has tools that are needed to do work, and this is especially true in computer programming. One could probably use notepad and save their code to a floppy disk, but tools have evolved to be much more functional and a pleasure to use. The cool thing about programming is that there is always room to grow and improve; the same comes into play with learning new tools. Here are five tools every programmer should use when coding.Several of the editors that I stick close to are the Sublime Text, Textmate, and Vim. I tend to lean more towards Vim only because I have become used to its commands and the lack of mouse usage. Plus, you get bragging rights just about everywhere you go. Sometimes, I need to sift through list of data or do some front end work, so I tend to use Sublime Text. Textmate was my previous editor and is now open source, so I included it for your consideration.Another great tool when you are learning a new language or testing stuff out is a great REPL tool for that language. REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. You can run the languages’ syntax through its provided REPL, giving you a better understanding of how the code works. Below is a list of REPLs I have used in the past:I listed the Chrome inspector for Javascript as a possible REPL program. Having a good browser helps when developing. Using Chrome’s inspector for console.log has saved my life many times. It is a great way to debug and helps when you are trying to find your way through the flow. Using breakpoints help when following data flow throughout your code, as well.Chrome also has numerous extensions that allow users to customize their experience, and there are some great extensions made for developers. If you are interested in building your own extensions, Google offers some great documentation to make that work. Overall, Google Chrome has a lot to offer for developers working on the web.“I love to run SQL statements and combine SQL statements on top of other SQL statements”, said no one ever. Below is a list of nice to use GUI tools for database management:Last, but not least, I believe every programmer needs a rubber duck.Talking code out loud or explaining usually leads to the solutions you need for your code. Too often I would call or message a mentor of mine and talk to them about my code, and a solution would come to me in mid sentence. This gives my mentor the ability to ask “Did you just rubber duck me?” which is an awkward question in itself. Talking code out with a rubber duck before bothering a mentor will save you more than it will make you feel strange.Find the tools that make you code productively and build you into a better programmer.

In order to do so, we have had two to three guest speakers each week come in and talk about their experiences in finding work, working for different companies, working for themselves, how to find work, how to interview, how to give public presentation, etc. We have given our students a wealth of information when it comes to finding a job and what to expect in those jobs. We have also put some stress on their online presence, which is important in this day and age because so much information about us is available online. In order for employers to take them seriously, we have been coaching them on how to optimize their online presence.In doing so, we came up with a checklist of things to look for when optimizing one’s online presence:[  ]  You have plenty of detail in your LinkedIn profile. What have you done? What measurable benefit has it provided?(Example of a great LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdstraughan; another one: https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardortega) Find some things in your past and make therm sound good![  ] You have and use an active Twitter account.[  ] Your Twitter profile has a link to your website and says that you’re actively seeking employment.[  ] You have no gaps in your timeline in LinkedIn.[  ] Your LinkedIn has a summary that includes prominently that you’re looking for employment.[  ] Your LinkedIn title is “Web Developer” or “Full-stack Web Developer.”[  ] You have a personal website + blog with your resume on it.[  ] You have written or will write several blog entries.[  ] You have a professional photograph on your LinkedIn and Github.[  ] Your LinkedIn has no typographical or spelling errors.[  ] Your LinkedIn has the opportunities wanted section completed.[  ]  You should update your LinkedIn weekly while searching for a job. It moves you to the top of the list.[  ] Your capstone project has a README with installation instructions.[  ] Your github has no misspellings.Hopefully, this list helps you better understand what is necessary to have a great online presence, one that will help you get hired by a great company.

https://dallasinnovates.com/codeup-set-to-open-dallas-campus/,Codeup Set to Open Dallas Campus » Dallas Innovates,"[Image: Khotcharak Siriwong via iStock]Although Codeup is launching a Dallas campus, make no mistake—this location will not be a “second Codeup.” Any of the startup’s additional campuses will “belong to one cohesive Codeup.”Codeup helps launch careers in computer programming or data science through its 20-week accelerator programs. Once equipped and trained with the necessary skills, candidates are connected to employers—the goal is to “embed greatness” in an organization.Codeup currently offers two 20-week programs: Full-Stack Web Development and Data Science. Each is focused on building the tech workforce and with a graduate placement rate of 97 percent over the last 18 months, the startup seems to be headed in the right direction.The San Antonio-based company was founded in 2013. Seven years later, Dallas marks Codeup’s first expansion outside of its homebase. “We didn’t pick a city, we picked a state,” Codeup announced in a blog post. The startup wanted to remain in Texas, while expanding the company outside of its HQ. Codeup found its solution in DFW.“If we were to go to Tampa, or if we had gone to Norfolk or gone to Kansas City, you’re officially opening a second Codeup,” Jason Straughan, Codeup’s CEO, told The Rivard Report. “But by staying in Texas and opening a campus in Dallas, we’re really just extending, we think, our San Antonio offering to another city.”The company chose Dallas as its second location because its graduates had already placed at companies with Dallas locations, including USAA and Cognizant.Codeup expects to open its Dallas campus with 24 students initially, according to The Rivard Report.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-student-check-in-month-2/,Codeup Student Check In: Month 2 - Codeup,"Oct 3, 2018 | Codeup NewsCodeup welcomed our newest cohort, the Wrangell cohort, on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we are launching a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We’ll interview a student over the course of their time with us to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 2!Check out Month 1 and Month 3.We took the time to sit down with our Wrangell student to see how they’ve been doing so far!Codeup: Describe what you’re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging? Wrangell Student: In this section of the curriculum we are learning about the basics of Java and the building blocks that make up the language. This language is more verbose than previous material, and one of the hardest parts is understanding the instructions and translating them to code. C: How has the learning process/information gathering been?S: A wide variety of resources are available. In addition to the curriculum, I utilize the Head First Java book and the Oracle documentation. Another challenge is combining the knowledge from all these resources into one.C: How do you feel your skill level compares to last month? S: Comparing my skill level now with that of last month is no contest. Everyone around me is improving as well and I am excited to see my classmates skill levels growing. Our skills are improving exponentially!C: How have the instructors and staff been helpful?S: The instructors hold study hall before class and after to give us extra help. They’re constantly posting resources in our slack channel and encouraging us to ask questions. They have no problem going back to review material or clarify any questions we have. At the same time, they encourage our learning. They don’t give us the answer if it’s obvious or an easily searchable question.C: Share a fun experience you had at Codeup!Our great staff gave us some very cool thermoses. I’m a diehard sticker fan. I immediately ordered coding and anime related stickers for this thermos and they’re going straight on the thermos the moment they come in!C: What has been the most memorable part of this month and has anything exciting happened?S: Codeup expanded onto the 6th floor of the Vogue building, so we’re coding in a totally different environment. It’s full of natural light, which makes me very happy. I personally love heights so it’s great to look out the windows while taking a break from coding.Something exciting that happened was that I got my first star! Instructors give us stars for asking good questions. I’m the type of person who needs to google the answer first before asking something. I wouldn’t want to ask something that is easily available on the internet. However, Java is very challenging, and I just needed to ask questions and I got a star!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/a-quest-through-codeup-2/,A QUEST THROUGH CODEUP - Codeup,"Jun 5, 2019 | Codeup NewsCodeup isn’t a cheap program – we know that. As one of the longest accelerators in the country, we recognize that cost is a concern for many prospective students. That’s why this week we are excited to highlight one of our long-standing financial aid partners – Project QUEST – to show you how many pathways are available.First of all, we view your tuition as an investment in your future, and we put our best people, ideas, and efforts to make that investment fruitful. But we also want to make that investment more accessible by providing as many financial pathways as possible for tuition funding. As we approach their annual fundraising luncheon this week, we want to highlight Project QUEST as one of the most effective such pathways you can explore.“The experience of attending Codeup has radically altered my life. Now, instead of financially treading water in a service industry job with a college degree that felt wasted, I have a fulfilling professional career with exciting possibilities for in-field advancement.” – Matthew CapperProject QUEST is a San Antonio based non-profit dedicated to workforce development and building our city’s future economy. They provide grant funding for educational and training programs, as well as career coaching and support resources (like utilities, childcare, and transportation). Over the last 4 years, Project QUEST and Codeup have collaborated to help dozens of students change careers.“Assistance from Project QUEST was invaluable and empowering. They offer incredible support for career training.” – Jesse RuizIn 2019 alone, Project QUEST has helped Codeup train 23 Software Developers and Data Scientists. Those students received grant funding (i.e. free money) anywhere from $2,000 to a full tuition ride, allowing them to fully focus on their education. Our combined efforts help empower life change, resulting in a 92% completion rate and a 95% employment rate of students receiving Project QUEST funding. And when we say life change, we mean it. The average starting salary leaving our program for Project QUEST participants this year was $59,000! That’s the salary floor, and there’s no ceiling. Considering that many of Project QUEST’s participants come from backgrounds of under or unemployment, these are generationally impactful numbers.“QUEST’s help compounded this opportunity by giving me enough fiscal assistance that I am now on more secure financial footing than I have been in my entire adult life.” – Matthew CapperIf you’re excited about Project QUEST’s impact on individuals and communities, support their work by donating here!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/top-trends-and-tools-for-recruiters-in-the-tech-industry/,Top Trends and Tools for Recruiters in the Tech Industry - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup News By Taylor McKinneyRecruiting new talent is never an easy task. But within the tech industry, it’s even more tricky—you want candidates with sharp skills and competitive experience, but also those who can make room to grow and adapt to new changes. The methods you use to recruit will directly influence who you attract, so you’ll need to get innovative with your strategies if you want the best. Here are the top innovative measures being used in recruiting for the tech industry today.A candidate with formal coding education is a must. A candidate with years of workplace experience is even better. But neither will necessarily guarantee you’re getting the best developer or programmer possible. That’s where coding assessments come in. This skill-based method makes the recruitment easier by relying on hard data, which reduces unnecessary decision making and possible bias. It’s the closest you’ll get to knowing exactly how capable a candidate is, and exactly how they’ll perform, logistically speaking, for your business.The interview process can be timely and even expensive, especially if you’re hoping to attract global or out-of-town candidates. Whether you use it for the interview itself or just the pre-screening process, a virtual session makes more efficient use of the selection process, both in time, money, and convenience. Try Google Hangouts or Skype for a free method, or check out a software review site for the best video interview software available.These systems are known for being cumbersome and, ironically, even inefficient because they’re so often hard to use or even used incorrectly. The good news is that these systems are simplifying their programs with the help of AI and rebranding themselves as “candidate relationship management software”. Employers can now count on these programs to correctly track all potentials without error, as well as recommend new qualified candidates.The standard “Where do you see yourself in five years?” question-and-answer interviews aren’t necessarily a bad thing, but they probably won’t land you any innovative hires. That’s why they’ve begun to fall by the wayside, especially in the tech world.While the core questions are still important, tech companies are now rebranding their strategies to shake things up a bit and make room for assessing soft skills and personality—the areas in which traditional interviews fall short.For example, the NFL susses out potential candidates by using Wonderlic, an online personality test that assesses emotional intelligence, determination, and overall demeanor.  Companies are also ditching conformity by trying out unconventional meeting places like a coffee shop or cafe. It’s all about getting to know a candidate better in a more dimensional way, and these new tools and methods are a way to get to know a truer sense of a person overall.And what about helping out with the time-consuming task of recruiting? Here are some of TrustRadius’s Top Rated recruiting software for 2018, which help streamline the recruitment process of searching for, attracting, interviewing, and onboarding new personnel.Oracle HCM CloudTrustRadius Score: 7.7 out of 10Best suited for large companies with many employees, a considerable budget, and complex needs.

One user says “it allows me to prescreen applicants without going through the interview process. I receive an email anytime there is a potential candidate to review.”JobDiva (8.6 out of 10)TrustRadius Score: 8.6 out of 10Fans of JobDiva appreciate its simple integration with external tools, convenient support, customizable features, and mass emails, which allow users to contact multiple qualified candidates all at once.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/fresh-out-of-codeup-cayden-simler/,Fresh Out of Codeup: Cayden Simler - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup News Digiboost recruits unprecedented talent from CodeupBy Mark A. Alvarez IIThere is so much more than meets the eye when meeting Cayden Simler, Digiboost’s newest developer. The Codeup graduate has set a new standard at Digiboost, by not only meeting expectations but exceeding them with his passion for technological innovation. From humble beginnings as a military child, moving from place to place, to building a life in San Antonio, Texas, Cayden is a one of a kind talent, displaying a multitude of skills ranging from CSS, JavaScript, PHP and troubleshooting methods for solving developmental problems. At Digiboost, Cayden hopes to empower and enable small business to thrive in a corporate world with his distinct style and approach to coding. “I want to be a part of building up the Digiboost brand while also building up the small businesses that come to us for support,” Simler said. “I really want to contribute and give back in the best way I know how.”After acquiring a taste for web development in high school, Cayden looked to Codeup as an alternative to obtaining a four-year degree. Codeup provided Cayden with a program focused on developing the skills required for his role as a web developer. Codeup’s hands-on approach to coding proved to be helpful to Cayden, allowing him to immediately put to practice everything he was learning. In just 16 weeks, Cayden was certified in Full Stack Development, dubbed the status of Junior Software Developer, and matched up with one of Codeup’s employer partners. The Codeup program is dedicated to providing its students with the skills necessary to effectively land an entry level coding position and launch their career in software development. “Codeup was designed exactly the way I needed it to be,” Simler said. “I gained the ability to problem solve, debug and learn new coding languages quickly. I  learned methods through whatever means necessary and created a fast entry into a career as a developer with the skills I needed to succeed.”Since starting at Digiboost, the team has been beyond impressed by the level of commitment and efficiency Cayden has brought to the company. His developmental knowledge has brought him to become one of Digiboost’s lead developers.“Cayden is a true asset to Digiboost,” Brian Campbell, Digiboost Client Care Specialist, said. “I hadn’t heard much about Codeup or the types of skills they taught, but Cayden is quite versed in several different coding forms. He has proven to be a great resource, either with live customers or with employees in the office. In the future, I can see Cayden moving into a senior type role very fast. But I believe his skill set is something we need and want him to get more advanced in.”Cayden’s display of talent and proficiency have proved to be the type of personality sought out by Digiboost. His pursuit of excellence within his field has proven to be quite the journey, one that has earned the admiration of his team and colleagues. Surely, looking to the future, Cayden is bound to leave a lasting impact at Digiboost while growing and utilizing his incredible talents. “I’m very excited for the future of tech in San Antonio and Codeup’s role in the tech district. This is an opportunity for us to all grow towards a shared vision,” Jason Straughan, CEO of Codeup, said.—This is the second of a new Codeup blog series which will feature guest articles related to software and technology.Mark A.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/women-in-tech-scholarship-recipient-amy/,Women in Tech Scholarship Recipient: Amy - Codeup,"Sep 5, 2018 | Codeup NewsOne thing that I can proudly say after this whole Codeup process is that I survived (and thrived) as an independent woman, although not without serious help from others!  This is my opportunity to thank those who have helped, including Codeup for generously offering me their Women in Tech Scholarship.Before Codeup, I was working full-time in another industry with a low salary.  I lived alone and was paying for all my rent and bills on my own, with no partner or parents for financial support.  In my field at the time, I struggled for years seeking advancement and growth opportunities from an industry that did not seem to value my skill set.Even given that stressful mindset, the idea of forfeiting my only source of income for several months to attend Codeup was extremely scary.  To justify this, I spent a lot of time researching, including attending Codeup sponsored events, and reaching out to Codeup alumni and friends in the tech industry for their opinion.  Still, with all the encouragement in the world, my objections were: Let me just go ahead and assure you that everything worked out – very well, in fact!  I made the leap of faith and decided to join the Redwood cohort. Here is my first person to thank: a male friend of mine who has been a programmer for years, who strongly encouraged me that this was a great direction for me to take to secure fulfillment and my continued independence.  I struggled to find statistics on this, but I have heard many similar stories from women about the men in their lives (friends, family, boyfriends, husbands) who work in the tech industry and encouraged them to learn to code.On the first day of class, I counted: 6 women out of 23 total students.  Not bad! Despite the fact that these women were of different ages, marital statuses, careers, and stages of life, we all quickly bonded.  Within the first few weeks, we even planned our own Girls Night Out at a bar across the street from campus (that the guys from our cohort crashed, and I don’t think anyone was upset about that)!  We also all participated in Codeup’s weekly women’s lunches, with featured female speakers who were alumnae or from the tech industry. Throughout the entire 18 strenuous weeks, these women and I supported and checked in with each other. Luckily, everyone in our cohort did the same, no matter the gender.  Thank you for this, Redwood women and men! To make a long story short, I was hired as a full stack developer a month before my graduation, with a decent pay bump from my previous career, and am now working in my second job in the field (yet another pay bump!) where I feel personally valued on a daily basis.  All of this, less than a year since starting Codeup!  As my final thank you, I am extremely grateful to Codeup for awarding me their Women in Tech scholarship, because it significantly reduced the loan amount I needed to attend, helped relieve a little bit of the anxiety of paying for Codeup, gave me more incentive to attend, and confirmed that I indeed was exactly what Codeup and employers were looking for in students and coders.If you’re a woman who desires independence and self-fulfillment, Codeup is worth it!  Make sure to apply to the scholarship during your admissions process and feel free to reach out to me or other female alumnae if you want to hear more about our experiences before, during, and after Codeup. —Amy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger’s first ever online ordering platform. She has a Master’s degree in Music Theory and keeps that knowledge fresh by analyzing music on the radio during her daily commute. Since learning to code, what she enjoys the most is mentoring new developers.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

So I took a risk and applied.C: What was the application process like?S: The application process is very easy to understand. You apply directly on the website, and a member of the team reaches out to you. There are a few steps in the process itself, including an interview, a campus visit and a skills assessment.C: Tell us about any financing options/grants/scholarships you received. Did you owe anything out of pocket?S: I’m very happy to report my expenses are fully covered by a few grants and scholarships. The City of San Antonio Workforce Solutions grant, the Alamo College Techworks grant, and the Women’s Scholarship all helped to cover the cost so that I paid nothing out of pocket.C: Describe a typical day for you from start to finishS: We start off with announcements and then what we call “push-ups,” which are morning exercises to practice our chops. Sometimes we work on yesterday’s assignment, or we jump straight into lecture. After lecture, we practice the material with an exercise. Then we have a lunch break. After lunch we come back and listen to afternoon announcements. We have lecture time again, followed by another exercise.C: Describe what you’re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging?S: Right now we are learning how to interact with the Google Maps API. This is probably the most challenging thing we’ve gone over so far. It’s very different extracting and working with code that is not your own. It feels like learning coding conventions all over again. But it’s still a lot of fun!C: How has the learning process/information gathering been?S: The learning process has been amazing. We use the Codeup curriculum website in combination with other resources, such as developer websites, and program documentation.C: What has been the most memorable part of this month?S: It is empowering seeing a project idea go from a blank slate to  a full functioning program. The most memorable part of this month was the first time I ran a program and saw all the colors and components jump out at me on the screen.C: How do you feel your skill level compares to when you started?S: My skill level has definitely increased compared to where I was initially. I think one of the most valuable things I’ve been taught are the tools that developers use on a daily basis such as Github, git, Node, the IntelliJ IDE and more.C: How have the instructors been helpful?S: The instructors are very receptive to feedback. They recognize that their students are extremely diverse with different skill levels, and respond in an understanding manner. They also encourage us to work hard for a problem answer, rather than just giving it to us outright.C:  Can you share a fun experience you have had this month?S: It is so much fun talking to my classmates and realizing how kind and open they are. I initially wanted to be alone on my lunch break, but then I had so much fun eating lunch with my classmates! I feel that Codeup is even helping me overcome my shy nature, and feeling the change within myself is fun and enlightening.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-student-check-in-month-3/,Codeup Student Check In: Month 3 - Codeup,"Nov 12, 2018 | Codeup NewsCodeup welcomed the Wrangell cohort on July 23. With the start of this cohort, we launched a new blog series: the Codeup Student Check In. We’ll interview a student over the course of their time with us to see how things are progressing from first impressions all the way to graduation. Thus, welcome to the Codeup Student Check In: Month 3!Check out Month 1 and Month 2. Codeup: How has your experience been at Codeup so far? Wrangell Student: I’ve had a great experience so far. Everything has been what I imagined and more. I have learned things in a short amount of time that otherwise would’ve taken me months upon months to learn. The people here are some of the kindest and most supportive people that I’ve met in a long time, and I’m happy to have this experience in my life. C: Describe what you’re learning right now. Is it hard/fun/challenging? S: We’ve just started our capstone project which is the final hurrah of our Codeup experience. We are in the planning stages and it’s honestly a little overwhelming due to the sheer amount of information we’re communicating to our teammates and because of the volume of work that’s going to be done over this next week or two. Nonetheless, I am excited by the challenge and I know that our final project is going to be something that I will be really proud of and really happy to have been a part of. I’m excited to see how it will all pan out. C: How has the learning process/information gathering been?S: I love doing research and the focus of my research has shifted from solely academic to a balance between academic and professional. I am still researching new technologies as well as doing further research into the current curriculum but now I am also doing research into potential companies I’d like to work with. I’m interested in their mission and if their goals align with mine, both short and long term.C:What has been the most memorable part of this month?S:The most memorable part of this month has been actually shopping for new interview outfits, looking at myself in the mirror, and seeing a young professional. This has been one of my long-term goals and it’s a great experience seeing it come to fruition.C:How do you feel your skill level compares to last month? S: I think my skill levels are increasing each month. Now that we are going into full stack applications I can finally see the cumulative success of my time here.C: How have the instructors and staff been helpful? Have you started working with the placement side of Codeup? If so, can you elaborate on that? S: I am grateful for the mock interview process with the instructors. It’s really helpful to have your instructors grade you on your performance and prep you for real world interviews. These instructors all have some sort of practical experience and firsthand knowledge of the professional world. Their experience and advice is invaluable.C: Did you learn anything new at Codeup that you weren’t expecting? S: I wasn’t expecting to learn as many people skills as I did. I thought this was strictly a technical school and this really came as a surprise. I have really learned how to network and how to talk to people that I otherwise would have been scared to talk to. I’ve learned that people are people, just humans, and improving conversational skills to talk with them is valuable. Learning the value of a human connection in the professional world is a very exciting thing.C: Have you been interviewing for jobs? What has that been like? If not, do you know what type of role you are looking for? (Ie. Developer, Q/A, Tech sales, Tech Ed, etc)S: I’ve had a few interviews this weekend and they have been very exciting and stressful. Having interviews back to back is both a blessing and a curse. It’s important to destress at home and really be aware of your emotions and reactions to stress. Time management is another big challenge. How much time do I put into studying versus interview prep? How much time can I dedicate to other life roles and be a good girlfriend, good daughter, and good pet owner while still fulfilling my role as a student and job seeker? These challenges are tough to overcome, and this is where emotional awareness can really help.C: If you can give one piece of advice to any prospective students, what would it be? S: Really do your research. Know what you’re getting into. You can’t go into anything blind! Get as much knowledge as you can so you can thoroughly prepare for and enjoy this journey. A great plan will save you a lot of suffering in the long run.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/why-san-antonio-has-more-than-tacos-to-offer/,Why San Antonio Has More Than Tacos To Offer - Codeup,"Apr 1, 2019 | Codeup NewsBefore moving to San Antonio, I was slightly apprehensive. Knowing little to nothing about the city, I didn’t know what to expect. All that had filtered down from the collective consciousness to my perception of the city was the obvious tourist attractions such as the Riverwalk, Alamo, and amazing Tex Mex. After spending a little under a year there, I came to fall in love with this city for reasons beyond what tourists can see in a weekend. The experience of its vibrant and proud Latino culture, flourishing art scene, and emphasis on community have left an indelible mark upon my life. All this aside, a huge part of my experience in San Antonio was attending Codeup, a coding boot camp that allowed me to have the skills needed to make a complete career shift and also an insider’s look into San Antonio’s flourishing tech community. For those of you that have never had a local’s perspective into the technology layer of San Antonio, I’m here to explain five reasons you should consider beginning a data science career here.Although San Antonio is usually overshadowed by its northern neighbor Austin, it is actually a humble but bustling tech hotspot according to Inc., a weekly business magazine. Especially as Austin’s infrastructure struggles to support its rapid expansion and population growth, corporations and talent have begun to siphon off to San Antonio, which is only an hour south. Cost-of-living is much lower compared to Austin and is an attractive option for anyone starting out in entry-level data science. Additionally, a 2018 CBRE report names San Antonio in the top 50 US markets for tech talent, and is rapidly rising. On top of that, San Antonio ranked first among small tech markets in millennial population growth, with 12.5 percent between 2011 and 2016. Brookings found even greater growth, more than 14 percent, among millennials in a January report. Where the talent goes, corporations will follow.   People may not realize it, but San Antonio is home to lots of large corporations such as USAA, HEB, Accenture, Hulu, iHeartMedia, Booz Allen — the list goes on. A quick Google search for data science jobs in San Antonio will pull up over a hundred active openings, all from corporations like the ones listed above. Additionally, SA Works conducted an analysis of over 30 business and thousands of job posts and has projected a higher growth in local tech jobs in San Antonio than the national average. Many of the corporations named above were found to be actively hiring for these positions. Data Science is also considered one of the best jobs in America for 2019, which makes it especially attractive with San Antonio’s affordable cost of living.A tight-knit community means that it is much more accessible for individuals to find resources that will aid them towards their goals, i.e. to become a data scientist. With even just a few months in San Antonio, I was able to see how welcoming and supporting the tech community is. With tech conferences, meetups, workshops, hackathons, and startup competitions galore, the community is truly thriving. The hub of a lot of this activity is Geekdom, a coworking space that serves as the central place for technology nerds to gather. Much of this community has a united vision to see technology flourish in San Antonio. For example, Tech Bloc was an organization created to advocate for policies that attract technology companies and talent to San Antonio. Even Codeup itself was created in order to produce more tech talent in San Antonio and drive growth. With so many determined and passionate technology stakeholders in San Antonio, its growth is inevitable! When I say “well-renowned”, it’s not because the majority of people talk about it. The thing about security is that… it’s typically discreet. However, San Antonio is actually the home of dozens of security startups, and some of the most prominent ones are nowhere near household names except perhaps for those that are familiar with the industry. Many of these companies would do well to not draw attention to themselves due to the nature of the work. In conjunction, the University of Texas at San Antonio has three separate cybersecurity centers, and one of them is the top-ranked program in the nation. In general, cybersecurity spending is growing globally, and this will, in turn, benefit the tech growth in San Antonio.  Growing up, I would hear my parents tell me that you need to look at someone’s wallet to know who they truly are. That is, it’s important to know how someone spends their money. One way to tell that San Antonio cares about technology is seeing how the city invests in technology initiatives. For example, there’s WiFi in eight of the city parks, solar-powered smartphone charging attached to benches, and even drones assisting in search and rescue operations. Additionally, the city and Bexar County have addressed the tech gap by budgeting up to 300,000 dollars to create a role for a chief talent and recruitment officer (CTRO). This individual, along with the local nonprofit Tech Bloc which administers the position, has a job that is two-fold: bringing in outside tech talent and matching local talent to organizations. In many ways, San Antonio is a city that many people seem to underestimate. I showed up without high hopes, dreading the Texas heat and bad drivers. However, it’s a place that I ended up finding some of my closest friends, along with a diverse community and thriving tech industry. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that it’s dubbed the Taco capital of the US. —Joyce Ling is a software developer at a cloud security company based in Richardson, TX.

With our first-class kicking off in February and only 25 seats available, we’ve been answering a lot of questions from prospective students. One, in particular, has come up so many times we decided to dedicate a blog post to it. What is the difference between data science and data analytics?First, let’s define some of our terms! Take a look at this blog to understand what Data Science is. In short, it is a method of turning raw data into action, leading to the desired outcome. Big Data refers to data sets that are large and complex, usually exceeding the capacity of computers and normal processing power to deal with. Machine Learning is the process of ‘learning’ underlying patterns of data in order to automate the extraction of intelligence from that data.  Now, let’s look at the data pipeline that data scientists work through to reach the actionable insights and outcomes we mentioned:Data professionals work at different stages of the spectrum to move data through the pipeline. On the left, Big Data Engineers specialize in collecting, storing, and processing data, getting it from Data to Information. In the middle, analysts work to understand and convert that information to knowledge. Lastly, a Machine Learning Engineer utilizes machine learning algorithms to turn intelligence into action by building automations, visualizations, recommendations, and predictions.Data Scientists span multiple stages of this pipeline, from information to action. They will spend about 70% of their time wrangling data in the information stage. They will conduct a statistical analysis to derive knowledge. Lastly, they predict future events and build automations using machine learning.For those technical folk out there, data science is to data engineering or machine learning engineering as full-stack development is to front-end or back-end development.

https://codeup.com/what-is-data-science/,What is Data Science? - Codeup,"Sep 7, 2018 | Data ScienceFirst of all, data science is a method of providing actionable intelligence from data using math, statistics, programming, and business expertise. Like any scientific method, it involves gathering data, identifying a problem, forming a hypothesis, and running tests. More specifically, data scientists follow a process of gathering and cleaning data (wrangling), investigation (exploratory data analysis), building automation using machine learning (feature engineering, model development, and deployment), delivering results (visualizations, reporting, storytelling), and maintenance. Practitioners typically spend 70-80% of their time in the wrangling/exploration, 20% on machine learning models, and the rest in maintenance. Most importantly, this whole process should result in a valuable action or insight for the end-user, i.e. a business or customer! At its core, data is just information – names, dates, times, $$, etc. Data scientists work with large collections of this information to draw conclusions. For example, they might use financial data to predict the seasonality of revenue generation or use the events of applications (like logins, clicks, or downloads) to detect security threats or fraud. Data science typically deals with ‘Big Data,’ which is too large and complex to manage on a local computer (see 4 Vs of Big Data for more). People interact with and create data like this every day: using smartphones, buying houses, rating movies, and more. You can thank data scientists (and the teams supporting them) for guiding you to your favorite Netflix series and helping optimize your workouts. There’s always more than one way to eat an oreo, and data scientists use dozens of different tools. At Codeup, data science tools include Excel, Python (programming language), SQL (databases), Hadoop (distributed data), Jupyter Notebooks (virtual notebooks for doing data science), and Tableau (visualizations). On top of that, they work with concepts from math, stats, and programming to write functions, create charts and graphs, and model patterns. Data science isn’t magic, and it isn’t rocket science either. At Codeup, data science is a skill set just like web development. The need for this discipline across all industries in San Antonio is rapidly growing and looking for new talent.

https://tribucodeup.wpengine.com/what-is-data-science/,What is Data Science? - Codeup,"Sep 7, 2018 | Data ScienceFirst of all, data science is a method of providing actionable intelligence from data using math, statistics, programming, and business expertise. Like any scientific method, it involves gathering data, identifying a problem, forming a hypothesis, and running tests. More specifically, data scientists follow a process of gathering and cleaning data (wrangling), investigation (exploratory data analysis), building automation using machine learning (feature engineering, model development, and deployment), delivering results (visualizations, reporting, storytelling), and maintenance. Practitioners typically spend 70-80% of their time in the wrangling/exploration, 20% on machine learning models, and the rest in maintenance. Most importantly, this whole process should result in a valuable action or insight for the end-user, i.e. a business or customer! At its core, data is just information – names, dates, times, $$, etc. Data scientists work with large collections of this information to draw conclusions. For example, they might use financial data to predict the seasonality of revenue generation or use the events of applications (like logins, clicks, or downloads) to detect security threats or fraud. Data science typically deals with ‘Big Data,’ which is too large and complex to manage on a local computer (see 4 Vs of Big Data for more). People interact with and create data like this every day: using smartphones, buying houses, rating movies, and more. You can thank data scientists (and the teams supporting them) for guiding you to your favorite Netflix series and helping optimize your workouts. There’s always more than one way to eat an oreo, and data scientists use dozens of different tools. At Codeup, data science tools include Excel, Python (programming language), SQL (databases), Hadoop (distributed data), Jupyter Notebooks (virtual notebooks for doing data science), and Tableau (visualizations). On top of that, they work with concepts from math, stats, and programming to write functions, create charts and graphs, and model patterns. Data science isn’t magic, and it isn’t rocket science either. At Codeup, data science is a skill set just like web development. The need for this discipline across all industries in San Antonio is rapidly growing and looking for new talent.

https://cloudacademy.codeup.com/a-rise-in-cyber-attacks-means-opportunities-for-veterans-in-san-antonio/,A rise in cyber attacks means opportunities for veterans in San Antonio - Codeup Cloud Academy,"In the last few months, the US has experienced dozens of major cyber attacks against leading organizations like Accenture, the NBA, and Kia Motors. Similar attacks are on the rise. This year, 38% more companies have experienced cyber attacks as compared to last year. Often, they involve a ransom payment in order to re-access stolen files. The amount paid by these victims has increased by 300%. In our headquarters of San Antonio, Texas, even local organizations are at risk. A few weeks ago, Judson ISD payed a $500,000 ransom.In 2020, there were over 300,000 open roles for cybersecurity professionals in the US. To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn’t demand – it’s supply.Luckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We’re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well positioned to continue to lead our country’s defense – not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well. But we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can’t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill® and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program.Want to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity? Help us train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals! Connect us with veterans in your network so we can all help continue San Antonio’s tradition of protecting our city and country!",[],[],[],[],True

You could become a web developer or data scientist or study UI/UX and graphic design. Or for those of you reading right now, you might be looking at entering a career in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud administration. Which might lead you to ask: what’s the difference, and which program is right for me?Both these programs at Codeup Cloud Academy are 13-weeks long. While they have different names, they share a lot of similar content as entry-level IT accelerators. Of the seven technical modules, four of them are shared. Both cover:Networking, Linux, Windows, and AWS are a LOT of content for new IT employees. Outside of this content, the programs split into their areas of focus:Now that you understand where the programs are similar and where they differ, which one is right for you? Here are some questions to consider:If you don’t have any work or education in IT, the System Administration program is the one for you. It is designed to be the 0-1 step in your IT career to get you started! If you do have work experience or education in IT, then you might be interested in Cyber Cloud. Why is that?Our programs focus on CompTIA certifications, which is a major industry provider in technical training. The typical track through their IT certifications is to start with their A+, then complete their Network +, and then progress to their Security +. That means if you don’t have your Network + (or relevant experience), it can be really hard to catch up. Still not sure which is right for you?

Up until recently, the System Administration program focused on Networking, Linux, and Rackspace cloud. Since Codeup’s acquisition of OCA in April 2021, these programs have been getting a makeover with an industry-first approach. Responding to employer needs has always driven Codeup’s historic employment outcomes. Now, it will for Codeup Cloud Academy (CCA) as well.Moving forward, both of CCA’s programs will teach the most in-demand cloud skills on the market: Amazon Web Services (AWS). While the System Administration program will still cover Networking and Linux, it has pivoted from Rackspace cloud to AWS. AWS is a cloud-computing platform that offers services across storage, computing, content delivery, and more with flexible, scalable, and reliable support. As the tech industry has evolved, more and more companies are moving from on-premises networking to the cloud, using providers like Amazon to manage their hosting. Since AWS is a leader in the industry, all CCA students will learn a variety of AWS topics across two of the AWS certifications: Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. By studying this content, students will become familiar with the fundamentals of the cloud, the suite of products offered by AWS, and how to architect a cloud solution.

Designed to help you launch your career in tech, these programs take you from 0 to IT hero with certifications and hands-on experience. But if you’re new to tech, you might be wondering…what is System Administration?In IT terms, a System Administrator (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:You might be thinking, “Woah, that looks like a lot!” and that’s because it is! A System Administrator is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today’s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don’t forget how the old saying actually ends: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.” So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?Now you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.  Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.Interested in learning more?

While 14,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost, over 19,000 new jobs had been created. Many of these were good paying jobs, but they required skills and expertise that were in short supply among San Antonio’s low-income residents. Project QUEST’s approach to training took shape through a process of grassroots community inquiry led by COPS (Communities Organized for Public Service) and Metro Alliance. Today QUEST is a nationally recognized workforce strategy with a 26-year history of successfully planning and implementing training programs for professional, high-paying jobs that enhance the economic competitiveness of San Antonio.

Please refer to your school’s refund policies and student agreements. If your school offers an employment guarantee refund, the terms and requirements set therein, as well as the decision to extend a refund in such a scenario, is solely at the discretion of your school. Please contact your school for any questions regarding an employment guarantee refund or a standard refund.Regarding your borrowed tuition funds:No, they’re consumer loans to help pay for tuition or cost of living at our partner schools.There are several key differences, and we encourage applicants to perform their own research into this topic. However, some of the high-level differences between an Ascent consumer loan for bootcamps and a private student loan include:Yes, you can add a cosigner to your loan. There are two ways to qualify for an Ascent bootcamp loan: on your own, or with a cosigner. Depending upon your credit health, a cosigner might be required. Cosigners may strengthen your application’s overall credit health. In some scenarios, adding a cosigner may reduce your interest rate and lower your payments. If you’re concerned about your eligibility for an Ascent loan, consider adding a cosigner with strong credit health.You can choose to add a cosigner before you submit your loan application, or may be given the option to add a cosigner after you apply.If you’d like to add a cosigner when you apply, you can select this option in the application. If your cosigner is with you, they can start their portion of the application right away. If not, we’ll send them an email asking them to complete their part. Your cosigner’s portion of the application will look very similar to yours.We’ll keep you and your cosigner updated on the status of your application throughout the process. You’ll receive an email or a notification in the application if you or your cosigner have any required steps to take.You will be charged an origination fee of 5.0%. This will be added to the amount you borrow and is included in the total loan principal amount you finance. It helps cover the administrative fees associated with originating the loan. It is the only fee charged for taking out this loan, and it affects your loan’s Annual Percentage Rate. See exampleYes, you can request to cancel or decrease your loan after you apply. Log in to your Ascent account at bootcamp.ascentfunding.com or reach out to [email protected] to request changes to your loan.If funds haven’t been sent to your school, Ascent can easily process a request to cancel or decrease your loan.  If funds have already been sent to your school, we’ll follow your school’s refund policy.Please note that Ascent can’t increase your loan amount after you apply. Instead, you may be able to cancel your loan and reapply for a greater loan amount.Our goal at Ascent is to help students from all walks of life and with a broad range of backgrounds get access to the programs that interest them. We offer two possible ways to qualify for an Ascent loan: on your own or with a cosigner.To see if you pre-qualify for an Ascent bootcamp loan, submit an application. In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score. In addition to learning more about your eligibility, you can also see the rates and terms you pre-qualify for.Applicants must be U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or DACA recipients with established credit history &amp; no outstanding education loan defaults. U.S. temporary residents may apply with a creditworthy cosigner that is a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident.Adding a cosigner can help strengthen your application’s overall credit health, and may even help lower your loan’s interest rate, APR, or monthly payments.While our application process asks for income and employment details, we won’t use income, employment, or your requested loan amount to evaluate your application.Yes. Individuals may apply as a borrower or cosigner based on their citizenship status as follows:Documentation requirements: The following are documentation will be required to verify your individual resident status:A VISA that does not expire within 6-months of the end of the enrollment period for which the loan is being requested. with an acceptable category as follows:  F-1, F-3, G Series, H-1B, H-1C, H-3, J-1, L-1, M-1, M-3, T-1, TNORAn I-20 Form (pages 1 &amp; 2 and signed by the school) and an unexpired passport from country of origin.You can submit an application and become pre-qualified as early as 90 days before your program. Pre-qualification allows you to preview your rates and loan options. In the pre-qualification process, we’ll conduct a soft credit check with no impact to your credit score. Before accepting a loan option, please ensure you have enrolled in your program.Yes, you can prepay your loan at any time without penalty. You have the flexibility to make early payments or fully pay off your loan without prepayment fees.Your interest rate is the base cost of borrowing money for the duration of your loan and is a percentage of the principal loan amount. It can be fixed (it will not change) or variable (it could change over time). Variable interest rates can increase or decrease throughout the life of your loan, which may result in your monthly payment changing over time. All Ascent loans for Codeup are fixed rate – your rate won’t go up!To see the status of your loan application, visit your Ascent account dashboard at bootcamp.ascentfunding.com. We’ll also send you emails throughout the process to keep you updated. You can save your progress in the application and return to it at any time.No, you can reduce your total cost by making early payments! This is a benefit we hope our borrowers take advantage of. When you apply for a loan, we show you as many details as we can upfront. One of those details is the total cost of the loan, which is the total amount you’ll pay over the scheduled lifetime of the loan. Our calculation of the total cost assumes that you will pay off your loan by making monthly on-time minimum payments for your entire loan term, which is either 36 or 60 months. The total cost includes (1) the origination fee of 5% of your loan amount, (2) the loan amount, and (3) the interest accrued over the lifetime of the loan.With our loans, you can make early payments or fully pay off your loan at any time with no prepayment fees. Many of our borrowers graduate from their programs, land jobs, and pay off their loans early! This is a financially smart move, because if you make early payments, you’ll accrue less interest over the lifetime of your loan. In summary – we don’t hold you to the total cost you see in your loan offers. If you make early payments, you can reduce the interest you accrue, which reduces your loan’s total cost!Richland State Bank, member FDIC, is the lender for all Ascent loans.For any additional questions, please complete this form.We'll send you our step-by-step guide to paying for your program.Skills Fund, LLC (d/b/a Ascent Skills Funding) products are made available through Richland State Bank, Member FDIC.2021 © Ascent Skills Funding.All Rights Reserved.We reserve the right to modify or discontinue (in whole or in part) these loan programs and their associated services and benefits at any time without notice.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/can-a-simple-algebra-test-predict-programming-aptitude/,Can a Simple Algebra Test Predict Programming Aptitude? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsEvery year since the establishment of Computer Science in the 1960s, 30-60% of CS college majors have failed their Introduction to Computer Science course because they simply could not learn to program. Despite hours of studying and tutoring, most of these underperforming students struggle with, and many ultimately give up on, programming as a career. So here is the ultimate question- Can a simple algebra test predict programming aptitude?Education researchers have been looking for the answer to that question for well over five decades. In that time, they’ve looked at dozens of possible predictors of programming aptitude, including:Most of these studies have found little to no predictive power in the variables they looked at. Or worse, when they do find something that’s predictive of programming aptitude, the techniques appeared to be so complicated that other researchers are unable to replicate their results at another university. Our impression is that research in this field has slowed. At this point, there seems to be no silver bullet for predicting one’s aptitude for early programming success.We’ve been running a hands-on coding Bootcamp that jump-starts students’ careers as computer programmers specifically for web application development. We accept less than 1/3rd of applicants. As part of the screening, we have prospective students take a basic algebra test.We also gauge student progress throughout the course and take note of individual progress using an internal normalized stack ranking. A student is given a 4.0 if they’re at the top of their class, and a 1.0 if they’re struggling to apply concepts learned in class. These stack rankings serve two purposes: first, they reveal who should be receiving 1-on-1 help and tutoring during the Bootcamp and, second, they stand as a useful measure of each student’s early programming prowess.Now that we’ve had over 60 students through our Codeup Bootcamp program, we decided to plot the two variables — performance on the algebra test and programming aptitude — against each other. Below, each dot represents a graduate. Shown above, our students’ performance on the algebra test predicts their future performance on programming tasks. As with all studies involving human subjects, there’s a fair amount of variance and outliers (e.g. the highly-rated student who scored only a 52% on the algebra test). But we can still confidently say that a student who scores a 75% or higher on the test will most likely be an above-average programmer, whereas a student who scores 60% or below will most likely be a below-average programmer.It’s important to note that students graduating from our Bootcamp program are entry-level web developers; they can write a complete MVC web application using PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript from scratch, but they won’t immediately be leading the software design team for the next Twitter or Facebook.It’s fairly common for incoming Computer Science majors to ask the question, “Why do I have to learn all this math if I just want to learn to program?” The correlation above suggests a possible answer: The ability to understand basic mathematics is likely correlated with the ability to “think algorithmically,” which is well-known to be a foundational skill for expert programmers. Computer Science was founded in mathematics, after all.On a more practical level, we’ve possibly found a simple method for sorting out the ninja programmers from the less capable programmers. So, if you’re a college student considering a major in Computer Science, take a look back at your algebra scores from high school to get a sense of your algebraic aptitude. And if you’re a recruiter for a growing tech company, try adding a basic algebra test to the interview process when hiring new programmers. In both cases, a 1-hour math test could save you thousands of dollars.At the beginning of the Codeup Bootcamp program, students are given between 35 and 55 minutes (depending on the test version) to complete a basic algebra test. The test contains 25-40 questions, such as:Adriana’s age is 1/3rd of her dad’s age. If her dad is 36 years old, how old is Adriana?andThere are 3 consecutive integers with a sum of 69. What are they?No partial credit is given.To determine a student’s overall stack ranking, we have our instructors periodically rank each student according to how well they have been performing in the current programming module. Students are assigned a 4.0 if they’re at the top of their class, and a 1.0 if they’re struggling to understand and apply coding concepts. The majority of the students receive rankings of 2.0 and 3.0 such that the stack rankings for the entire class form a normal distribution. A student’s overall stack ranking is simply the average of their stack rankings over the entire Bootcamp.The chart above shows the linear regression over the performance data of all 62 students who have graduated from Codeup Bootcamp. These 62 students come from 3 separate cohorts who took 3 distinct algebra tests. Scroll to the graphs at the bottom of this post to see that, when applied to the data from individual cohorts, all linear regressions show the same positive correlation between test score and programming aptitude with p &lt; 0.01. This finding has therefore been replicated twice with three distinct cohorts of students.In summary, these math tests – along with stack rankings – have been a handy diagnostic tool for us, and we’d like to share our findings with the world in an effort to both shed light on our own experience and hear plenty of feedback from others. In this new and growing industry, there is so much to learn, and we hope that this study provides food for thought and space for conversation.Feel free to send lots of comments, questions, and suggestions our way! (See discussion about this post on Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8741868).Interested in learning more about our program and admissions process?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/what-is-the-value-of-a-codeup-education/,What is the Value of a Codeup Education? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsThis is a guest article by Michael Taylor, originally posted at The Rivard Report and Bankers Anonymous. Like many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans.But as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. [1] It’s the bottom-line question: “How is this making me money, like, right now?” [2]One of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “Boom! I got this!”Philosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?The weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley – who started the computer coding school Codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try.In less than two years he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now? Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup.“The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.”What does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate. I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the time value of money speech that you don’t want to hear again.With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can calculate what that amount is worth today by using a discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.I have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. [3] Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars.That discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K, today. [4] Another way of putting it is that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal. “The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.”So that’s interesting.We can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average.I mean, I’m sure they are.But still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke.How much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? Again, I don’t think it’s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of money in the future not being worth as much money today. Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career.But what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before? [5] Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44. Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition.With those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: “What if I was to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?”Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.”Most important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens.But – and this is a big but [6] – it’s not a crazy assumption. Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens.It’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It’s an assumption that markets are somewhat efficient.  It’s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employers and work situations just like other people.All of which makes me pretty confident that the financial return on a skills upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 times the upfront tuition cost.As I said before, education leads to more sparkling conversations as well as to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt.But I appreciate my friend Girdley’s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 times multiple of your investment. Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in?——–Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/how-we-got-non-programmers-to-fizzbuzz-in-less-than-a-week/,How we Got Non-programmers to Fizzbuzz in Less Than a Week - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup News, Tips for Prospective StudentsWe are about to begin our fourth week of Codeup, and the students are currently learning about HTML and how it works with PHP. In three full weeks, our students have learned more about programming in general than most people who start learning on their own. During the first week of instruction, we get our students right to coding. At the end of that week, we have them develop simple programs in command line.We begin our instruction with an introduction to the command line and the interactive shell. In a future blog post, we will discuss more about what type of environment our students are working with and how to set it up on your computer. For now, we are using Vagrant to boot into our virtual machine in order to make sure all the students are using the same version of PHP and other software. In the interactive shell, students are introduced to PHP and experiment with code there.From there, we teach students the fundamentals of programming, such as data types and control structures. In PHP, there are multiple data types, so at the beginning, we focus on scalar data types. Afterwards, we challenge our students with arrays and how they can hold other scalar data types along with other arrays.We also discuss variables, logical and comparison operators, and type juggling to give students a better understand of how variables and the data types variables store can be manipulated using PHP. All the while, we are giving students real world examples of how these fundamentals can be used. This is to keep in their mind that a strong understanding of the fundamentals will lead to a better programming experience. Along with variables and type juggling, we also introduce students to PHP functions, such as echo, var_dump, and print_r, to help them understand how debugging works and to see what their variables and data types look like as PHP is evaluating them.Toward the end of the week, we talk to our students about loops, such as while, do-while, and for loops. With this knowledge, the students are able to move through loops and have code working within the loops to have specific outputs.We spend some time each day lecturing, but the majority of the time, students are coding through assigned exercises. They have instructors and fellows moving about the classroom ready to help them if they have a question. We want to make sure students get as much personal attention as possible with our unprecedented teacher-student ratio.By the end of the week, the students have a strong understanding of how variables work, how math works in PHP, what control structures are and how to use them, what are the data types in PHP, and how to use loops. We challenge them to build FizzBuzz, which is a simple command line application that uses these fundamentals in a real way.FizzBuzz, for those of you who do not know, is a program that prints out a set of numbers, normally from 1 to 100. For every number that is divisible by 3, the computer prints the word “Fizz” instead of the number. For every number that is divisible by 5, the computer prints out the word “Buzz” instead of the number. Lastly, for every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, the computer prints out “Fizzbuzz.” There are a number of ways to do it, but the knowledge of the fundamentals of programming is imperative.Interested in learning how to “FizzBuzz,” a common technical task in interviews?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/why-a-recent-grad-should-do-codeup/,Why a Recent Grad Should do Codeup - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsOur newest hire, Rafa, has recently finished his third year in college, studying Computer Science. He came on our team because he is interested in entrepreneurship and our instruction methods and he believes that our environment is a great place to learn how to code.He wrote a guest blog to discuss why a recent grad should do Codeup:Codeup is a comprehensive programming bootcamp teaching non-programmers web development. Anybody who is interested in web development stands to learn and practice a great deal of skills during the course.Personally, I have recently completed my junior year at Arizona State University, where I am majoring in Computer Science. In the classroom, I have learned a lot about all the different types of sorts, running times, different software architectures, and so on. However, what I have not learned is how to effectively develop a web application. This is where the knowledge gained during college studies differs from the knowledge gained during the Codeup course.Codeup teaches people how to develop a web application and everything that this entails. Additionally, the teacher to student ratio at Codeup is vastly improved over the teacher to student ratio at many schools. Codeup has 2 or 3 instructors for 28 students, whereas in college courses where there is only 1 teacher and a few teacher assistants for a 70 plus person class. At Codeup, the focus is on the students instead of on the school football team, meaning that the curriculum is based on the performance of the students, and it is designed to push them further. The environment at Codeup is great in which to learn how to code.Additionally, the Codeup course teaches the students a variety of professional skills with the purpose of helping the students get hired after the course. The Codeup team is so confident in the course that they offer a job guarantee. If a student does not receive a good job offer within 6 months of completing the course, the course tuition will be refunded. The idea is that if students cannot succeed after the class, Codeup does not succeed, so they work hard to make certain students can find employment at great businesses.If you have graduated from college recently, with or without a CS degree but do not feel like you currently have a market-ready skillset, then Codeup is definitely something that you should take a look at. At the end of the course, you will be able to fully develop a web application. This, in combination with the variety of professional skills learned throughout the course, will make you an attractive employee to a wide variety of companies.Thank you, Rafa, for writing this blog.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-set-to-open-coding-school-in-dallas/?share=email,Codeup Set to Open Coding School in Dallas,"San Antonio ReportCodeup, a homegrown career school for aspiring software developers, is expanding to Dallas.The Houston Street immersive coding school for adults is taking its web development program to the Big D with plans to open a downtown Dallas campus in early 2020, CEO Jason Straughan told the Rivard Report Friday.The company announced in a blog post its intentions to launch in Dallas to serve a growing need for tech workers in the Dallas-Forth Worth metropolitan area. Pending approval from the Texas Workforce Commission, which regulates career schools and colleges in the state, Codeup is set to open in Dallas with an initial cohort of 24 students studying full-stack web development, which includes programming the design and behavior of a website as well as the underlying data and backbone of a website.As Straughan and the team at Codeup contemplated a potential expansion beyond state lines, the need to grow within it became clear, he said.“When you start looking at the needs of tech workers in Texas, it is just unbelievable and continues to grow,” he said. “Roughly 42 percent of all tech jobs are in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area.”The sheer demand in the DFW area has become increasingly apparent to Codeup as it has placed a tenth of its graduates in jobs there over the past year and a half, Straughan said. Despite being five hours away from San Antonio by car, Dallas remains within close enough proximity to the other four major cities in Texas that Codeup sees its new school in that city as an extension of the San Antonio campus, Straughan said.“If we were to go to Tampa, or if we had gone to Norfolk or gone to Kansas City, you’re officially opening a second Codeup,” he said. “But by staying in Texas and opening a campus in Dallas, we’re really just extending, we think, our San Antonio offering to another city.”Codeup has taken a different tack to growth than many of its national peers in the coding school space. Whereas contemporaries such as The Iron Yard and Dev Bootcamp focused their business on aggressive expansion in top tech markets, and subsequently shut down, Straughan said Codeup has chosen to hold off on expanding its footprint for the first seven years.After launching a data science boot camp this year, and growing its Downtown San Antonio space, Codeup set its sights on expanding outside of the city. Adding more classes and programming too quickly in San Antonio would have oversaturated the market, Straughan said.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Codeup has signed a lease at the historic Katy Building in Downtown Dallas, located at 701 Commerce St., and expects the Texas Workforce Commission to decide whether to approve the new school within the next few months.Nearly 100 students enrolled in Codeup’s most popular offering, a 20-week full-time program focused on web design and development, between September 2016 and August 2017, the most recent report published on the Texas Workforce Commission’s website. Just over 80 percent of those enrolled completed the 600-hour, $27,500 program, and close to three-quarters of them found related employment after graduating, according to the commission.",[],[],[],[],True

Schools like ITT Tech and Career Point College have been peddling expensive, low-ROI degree programs for years. Students take out a loan to cover costs, only to discover that the school’s career services department doesn’t measure up. They graduate with few job prospects and lots of debt.Recently, regulators have shut down those schools because they’ve failed to put students’ interests above their own.We care about your finances, and we believe you’ll be a more engaged Codeup student and a better developer when you minimize your financial burdens. Our staff wants to help you do just that, so here’s our commitment to you:It’s that simple, and because we love transparency, here’s how we ensure our team always puts your financial well-being at top of mind:A fair and selective admissions process.

Modeled after Codeup’s successful learn-to-code programs, Veteran Bootcamp will train students for careers as professional computer programmers, but with a twist: it’s free. The bootcamp is entirely funded through a contract from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, awarded to Coley, who partnered with Codeup to provide this valuable training to Veterans and Transitioning Servicemembers. Veteran Bootcamp is part of the Veterans Economic Communities Initiative, which fosters education and employment opportunities for Veterans at the community level. Qualified students can participate in the bootcamp at no cost, without using GI Bill benefits. Veteran Bootcamp is a 250+ hour program taken part-time over 16 weeks at Codeup’s campus in downtown San Antonio. Students have completed pre-work remotely and will begin in-class training this evening, focusing on front-end technologies like JavaScript, HTML, WordPress, and CSS. Graduates will be prepared for jobs as entry-level front-end web developers and software engineers.According to Computerworld, IT jobs are expected to grow at 22 percent annually through 2020. “There’s clearly a huge gap between the skills in our workforce and the needs of employers,” said Michael Girdley, CEO of Codeup. “We’re proud to be part of this solution, especially with San Antonio’s role as Military City USA.”At a glance:About Codeup: Codeup is a computer programming bootcamp in San Antonio, TX with a mission to change people’s lives by helping them launch careers in tech.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/competitor-bootcamps-are-closing-is-the-model-in-danger/,Competitor Bootcamps Are Closing. Is the Model in Danger? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup News In recent news, DevBootcamp and The Iron Yard announced that they are closing their doors. This is big news. DevBootcamp was the first programming bootcamp model and The Iron Yard is a national player with 15 campuses across the U.S. In both cases, the companies cited an unsustainable business model. Does that mean the boot-camp model is dead?Bootcamps exist because traditional education models have failed to provide students job-ready skills for the 21st century. Students demand better employment options from their education. Employers demand skilled and job ready candidates. Big Education’s failure to meet those needs through traditional methods created the fertile ground for the new business model of the programming bootcamp.Education giant Kaplan and Apollo Education Group (owner of University of Phoenix) bought their way into this new educational model when they purchased The Iron Yard and DevBootcamp. They purchased their competition with the intent to scale up the model. Unfortunately, Big Education is too habituated to coming up short for students. They bought the upstarts that challenged them, tried making changes to run those bootcamps in the “Big Education” way, and, sadly, they’ve closed the doors when they realized that scaling education is more challenging when student outcomes truly matter.The bootcamp model is still new and there will be plenty consolidation, competition, and changes in the future. This model is based on actually being adaptive, innovative, and sustainable. And there’s always room for innovation.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/what-the-sa-tech-job-fair-says-about-san-antonio/,What The SA Tech Job Fair Says About San Antonio - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup News Last night, Codeup co-hosted the first San Antonio Tech Job Fair at the Geekdom Event Centre. By the numbers, it was a great success:The great news for San Antonio is that young people are indeed looking to tech careers as a path to build a rewarding future. At the same time, it’s clear that we need to do more to get those young people ready to succeed in the tech workforce.I personally spoke to over a hundred job seekers, and my booth-mate Dylan did, too.We talked with dozens of recent computer science grads of local colleges and universities. They wanted entry-level jobs, but when I asked, “What have you built that is real?”, they pointed to toy applications and homework assignments. The students succeeded in their coursework – the curriculum simply didn’t arm them with applied, job-ready skills.We also spoke to employers and saw which jobs the employers were looking to fill. All of the recruiters were targeting senior and mid-level technical positions. The big company employers were searching for the same.It’s clear that San Antonio is getting good at producing entry-level talent, but we still have a huge gap in technical ability. The main takeaway after talking to both job seekers and job givers is that the San Antonio workforce isn’t where tech employers want it to be. It’s the responsibility of both the educators and the employers to become much more involved in solving that problem.Moving forward, there are two challenges for us as a community. First, educational programs (including Codeup) need to continue to evolve and guide talent beyond entry-level skills. Second, companies need to take talent development seriously to grow more senior talent out of these young people.We’re working on the problem. It’s time other parts of the community stepped up as well.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/open-for-bitcoin-business/,Open for (Bitcoin) Business - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsAt Codeup, we guide students through 18 weeks of rigorous curriculum and equip them with a comprehensive understanding of software development. We designed our program to challenge students in a number of areas, but financing is not one of them. That’s why we offer various financial options, enabling students to pay for Codeup with the funding plan that works best for them.Since we are always looking to accommodate the needs of our students, we recently added another form of payment to our list of funding options. James Canning, a current student who went through Codeup’s application and on-boarding process from overseas, was able to pay the program fee entirely with bitcoin! Here is what he had to say about the experience:I recently started the full-time web development boot camp at Codeup in San Antonio, Texas. Codeup is one of the most comprehensive and best-reviewed developer training programs available. One of the main reasons I chose Codeup is because I was able to pay in bitcoin, the currency in which I receive my income.I always ask businesses I might transact with if they accept bitcoin; in the case of Codeup, I included this paragraph when I emailed them to enquire about the course:“By the way, if Codeup accepted bitcoin for payments it would be very beneficial for both parties. With a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase, Codeup gets instant USDs in its bank account for less than half the fees of credit cards or PayPal with 0 chargebacks and 0 fraud.”Because Codeup does their invoicing through QuickBooks, they easily added the bitcoin payments option with QuickBooks’ excellent PayByCoin feature, which uses Bitpay, the same processor Microsoft, Namecheap, Newegg and others use.Codeup emailed me the invoice as normal and I was able to pay the program fee in moments, from anywhere in the world.I will post a full review after the course, but so far the boot camp is excellent. Codeup achieves a friendly and supportive atmosphere and is thoroughly integrated into the local tech scene. Over 90% of graduates from the first four classes received job offers in the 6 months following the course. Personally I am not taking the course to get hired but rather to take my site, Bitedge, to the next level.If you want to learn web development and pay in bitcoin, then Codeup is by far the best option. If you use QuickBooks for your invoicing you should enable bitcoin payments!You can catch the full version of James’ story here.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

And did. - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsIn case you didn’t know, last week was kind of a big deal. A five-day marathon termed “Startup Week” coursed through our city, leaving a slew of entrepreneurs, students, developers and dreamers inspired in its wake. The jam-packed celebration featured over 55 speakers and 68 free events, and ended up drawing in more than 270 attendees! Not too shabby, San Antonio.So, who’s behind all this magic, anyway?As the chief organizer of SA Startup Week, Vanessa Paige, Operations Manager at the 80/20 Foundation, worked behind the scenes to coordinate the madness and keep things sailing smoothly. For Vanessa, last week was about building San Antonio’s entrepreneurial ecosystem and breaking down its barriers to entry:The entire week opened up the door to learn more about starting up a venture – or just learning about an industry or topic of your choice…It gave the public a taste of entrepreneurship and access to the movers and shakers that are directly impacting the ecosystem in downtown SATX.Job well done, Vanessa!Another key driver of last week’s success were the sponsors and venues that came alongside Vanessa’s efforts and provided a grounds for inspiration and collaboration by opening their doors to the community,. As one such sponsor, we were able to host five events in-house! One of our favorites was a dialogue between community leaders Pat Matthews and Lorenzo Gomez. Just two CEOs engaging in a casual conversation, but with a twist: there was an audience! Bright-eyed listeners came from far and wide, simply to be in the same room as these two passionate visionaries. It. Was. Awesome. And in case you missed it, we put it on YouTube. You can thank us later.Until next year, Startup Week! Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-helps-rails-girls-help-women-learn-to-code-in-san-antonio/,Codeup Helps Rails Girls Help Women Learn to Code in San Antonio - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsThis moment in history is exploding with stories about women breaking new ground in technology, summits of female tech leaders, and invitations for women to learn new technology skills so that IT teams and development shops can benefit from gender parity. Organizations like Rails Girls are fueling the fire by providing women and girls with the tools and community they need to learn, and to be confident with new coding skills. This week, Rails Girls is putting on a free, two-day workshop in San Antonio where they will teach women how to program using Ruby on Rails.At Codeup, we’re all about community, collaboration, and partnership. It’s our lifeblood to be an integrated force in San Antonio’s landscape of blooming, new tech talent. We also work to fuel the dreams, goals and future potential of women in tech careers. So when we heard about the upcoming Rails Girls workshop, we only had one question, which we managed to sandwich between our fangirl squeals: Can we partner with you?! They said yes, we cried tears of joy, and our shared mission has us both super invested in the success of the upcoming workshop. How are we investing? Well, our time, treasure, and talent are the best things we can give! Two of our esteemed team members, an instructor and one of our curriculum developers, as well as our co-founder and his team of developers, will be participating as on-site mentors to help facilitate the learning process. As educators and friends, these folks embody who we are and what we do at Codeup. Here’s their take on the weekend’s programming festivities:Ryan Orsinger, our full-stack bootcamp instructor, says, “Rails Girls makes a global impact for gender parity in the programming community. Codeup makes an impact for gender parity in the San Antonio programming community.” It’s a perfect match of shared goals!Ryan goes on to say that his “decision to volunteer as a coach for Rails Girls is simple. Programming is the new literacy, and everyone should have exposure and experience in this field. I’m thrilled that San Antonio will be hosting its first (of many) Rails Girls workshops.”   Agreed, Ryan.  Now, meet Tarek Hafez, a curriculum developer here at Codeup: Another awesome supporter of Rails Girls from our community is Jason Straughan, a Codeup cofounder, our CTO, and founder and head guy in charge of everything at a Grok Interactive, a web application development company. He’s sending his developers to also mentor the event.“Louis, Anton, and Joseph and I are going to be coaches for Rails Girls…I’m pumped,” said Josh Freeman, senior software developer and former instructor for Codeup teen summer coding camps. Not only that, Joseph is a also Codeup-grad-turned-Grok-developer! According to Josh, the developers at Grok are never done learning and studying, an ideal that “meshes well with Rails Girls, where you’re trying to train and introduce new people to programming. That’s why we jumped at the opportunity.” Although the Rails Girls workshop will only be in San Antonio for a weekend, the organization has already planted its compelling, and contagious, vision in our city.In our coding bootcamps people come in with dreams, hopes, fears, and wonder. Can I do this? Can I really learn a new set of skills in four months, become a valuable developer, and end up with a completely new job, new life, and new trajectory? And women especially bring a different set of sensitivity and caution. We meet their wise concerns with a great confidence-building foundation of real skills to maximize their value in the tech landscape. Can I really do this? Is there room for me in the 73% tech industry? Can I make a difference?Great questions. And we answer them with a resounding yes because we see it happen again, and again, and again.*You may still be able to snag a spot at this weekend’s workshop!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-doubles-down-on-transparency-in-student-outcomes/,Codeup Doubles Down on Transparency in Student Outcomes - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsWith pride and excitement, we’d like to announce that Codeup is an official founding member of the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting (CIRR). Codeup and all CIRR member institutions have agreed to a detailed set of student outcomes standards that eliminates unreliable graduation rates, ambiguous definitions of employment, and misleading exclusions from job placement rates.We’re doubling down on our commitment to long-term student success, and we’re confident that CIRR will add an extra layer of value and integrity that our alumni, current students, and prospective applicants already expect from their Codeup education.At all stages of the Codeup program – admissions, in-class immersion, and the job search – our staff and instructors aim to provide students with realistic advice, so they can make the most of their software development education. Historically, we’ve done this in three ways:Even with ongoing efforts to improve these processes that monitor student success, however, we’re the first to admit that we’re human. As a small, evolving program, we recognize that we can always provide students with better feedback through detailed performance evaluations, structured student one-on-ones with instructors and staff, and transparency in student outcomes data.Our team has already addressed evaluations and one-on-ones, but forming a consensus on bootcamp outcomes data has been an industry-wide puzzle until now.We began resolving this issue by asking ourselves a follow-up question:With transparency and accuracy, how do we report on students who leave Codeup or do not obtain employment?Fortunately, other principled, results-driven coding bootcamps have asked themselves the same question, and over the past year, we’ve come together under the CIRR umbrella. For the sake of our students, our alumni, and the future of our unique approach to coding education, we’ve agreed to a detailed set of standards that establish new definitions, documentation, and validation requirements related to student graduation and job placement data.Critical feedback from students and alumni on bootcamp outcomes has informed so much of the CIRR process. Thanks to this input, the CIRR standards support the concerns of these very students by enforcing strict standards for student outcomes reporting and, in turn, providing Codeup with even more incentive to ensure student success.We appreciate our community for holding Codeup accountable to the high standard you deserve. We hope you will continue to do so, as we advance our mission to help people launch rewarding careers in software development.As always, please feel free to reach out to any members of the Codeup staff or info@codeup.com with any questions or comments.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

LaunchCode, meet Codeup. That’s right…we have a new partner! Codeup has recently joined forces with LaunchCode, a St. Louis-based nonprofit that uses an apprenticeship model to place motivated programmers (i.e. Codeup grads) within a vast network of potential employers. LaunchCode’s employer partner network spans over 300 companies nationwide, ranging from smaller startups to big-name companies like MasterCard, all in need of tech talent. And that’s where we come in. After four months of intensive bootcamp immersion, our grads have some serious skills. Thanks to this partnership, our grads will gain access to a world of job placement and paid apprenticeship opportunities so they can put their new skill set into action.Our bootcamps are a nontraditional, effective way to learn to code. Many companies already recognize and benefit from the value of bootcamp grads, but some are still unsure of how to best integrate them into a team. One thing that makes LaunchCode an ideal partner for us is that their model creates opportunities for driven programmers, regardless of whether or not they have traditional credentials. And this model is working: over 90% of LaunchCode’s apprenticeships are converted to full-time hires within 90 days.You may be thinking “But Codeup, don’t you already have a stellar hiring rate?” To which we reply: Staaaahp. We’re blushing. But to answer your question, yes. While 94% of our graduates find work within 6 months, we are always aiming to increase opportunities for students post bootcamp. Before the partnership, we were working within a network of 64 partner employers, many of which are based here in San Antonio. By teaming up with LaunchCode, we’re expanding our connections beyond San Antonio, so our grads will be able to find their dream jobs not just locally, but across the nation!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/itt-tech-closes-new-model-of-education-rises/,"ITT Tech Closes, New Model of Education Rises - Codeup","Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsThe 2016 closure of ITT Tech highlights the time barriers, financial risk, and poor career prospects that are finally catching up with the traditional for-profit education industry. So what can students do instead?Forbes Magazine ranked San Antonio as the American city with the 15th highest rate of job growth in 2015 – no surprise given our city’s recent swell in tech and entrepreneurship. The boom has created a mismatch between a surplus of available jobs for developers and a shortage of local technical talent. Codeup, a career accelerator that trains software developers and data scientists, has begun bridging that gap by training over 700 students and creating over $7 million in new tech salaries since 2013. Codeup is different from traditional models of continued education. Four-year universities and two-year technical schools often no longer serve students’ needs. The closure of ITT Tech, one of the nation’s largest for-profit educational institutions, is a great example. Tuition at schools like ITT Tech, DeVry, and Kaplan is high ($45,000 – $90,000), they have been found to use predatory lending practices, and they rank highest among colleges that leave students in the most debt. Graduates of ITT Tech San Antonio who received federal financial aid earned an average salary of only $38,400 ten years after completion, just barely above the national average for the category. Their overwhelming time commitment, high tuition fees, and limited career support make it hard for students to complete degrees and advance their careers. Given the decline of these diploma mills and a changing jobscape, other forms of education have exploded. The new reality is that the traditional college student archetype is now a minority, while demands for alternative, dynamic educational models are only increasing. Students need a better way to enter the workforce with relevant technical skills.  As a six-month intensive career accelerator, Codeup offers something special: a place where students can find like-minded peers and launch a new career. Our classroom-based program turns non-techies into software developers. In addition to excellent technical instruction, students receive one-on-one career guidance and gain opportunities to connect with employers. If a graduate cannot find employment within 6 months, Codeup offers a tuition back guarantee. We partner with multiple reputable loan and grant partners to make financing easy, and also accepts GI benefits. Graduates have increased their salary by $17K in the first year on average. In light of the recent closings of ITT Tech across the country, students should pause to reconsider their educational path choices. Codeup is Texas local, dedicated to providing students with community, professional independence, and technical literacy. Are traditional models the best option, or might Codeup offer something better?If you want to learn more about that, call us.

Am I looking for a career transition or more education? What post-graduation outcomes can I expect?Do I want an interactive, hands-on, full-time model, or do I prefer working on my own with a part-time, online program? What are my tuition options to support my cost of tuition?If I invest $X,XXX, how much can I expect to get back in my first year of employment? What is the opportunity cost of going to school for 6 months vs 2 years?Codeup will help you land a job or give you back 100% of your tuition.

https://cloudacademy.codeup.com/a-new-cloud-moving-in/#respond,A New Cloud Moving In - Codeup Cloud Academy,"Codeup Cloud Academy adds Amazon Web Services (AWS) to its System Administration program.The organization formerly known as Rackspace Open Cloud Academy (OCA) has two programs: System Administration and Cyber Cloud. Up until recently, the System Administration program focused on Networking, Linux, and Rackspace cloud. Since Codeup’s acquisition of OCA in April 2021, these programs have been getting a makeover with an industry-first approach. Responding to employer needs has always driven Codeup’s historic employment outcomes. Now, it will for Codeup Cloud Academy (CCA) as well.Moving forward, both of CCA’s programs will teach the most in-demand cloud skills on the market: Amazon Web Services (AWS). While the System Administration program will still cover Networking and Linux, it has pivoted from Rackspace cloud to AWS. AWS is a cloud-computing platform that offers services across storage, computing, content delivery, and more with flexible, scalable, and reliable support. As the tech industry has evolved, more and more companies are moving from on-premises networking to the cloud, using providers like Amazon to manage their hosting. Since AWS is a leader in the industry, all CCA students will learn a variety of AWS topics across two of the AWS certifications: Certified Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Associate. By studying this content, students will become familiar with the fundamentals of the cloud, the suite of products offered by AWS, and how to architect a cloud solution.

Designed to help you launch your career in tech, these programs take you from 0 to IT hero with certifications and hands-on experience. But if you’re new to tech, you might be wondering…what is System Administration?In IT terms, a System Administrator (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:You might be thinking, “Woah, that looks like a lot!” and that’s because it is! A System Administrator is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today’s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don’t forget how the old saying actually ends: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.” So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?Now you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.  Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.Interested in learning more?

https://cloudacademy.codeup.com/a-rise-in-cyber-attacks-means-opportunities-for-veterans-in-san-antonio/#respond,A rise in cyber attacks means opportunities for veterans in San Antonio - Codeup Cloud Academy,"In the last few months, the US has experienced dozens of major cyber attacks against leading organizations like Accenture, the NBA, and Kia Motors. Similar attacks are on the rise. This year, 38% more companies have experienced cyber attacks as compared to last year. Often, they involve a ransom payment in order to re-access stolen files. The amount paid by these victims has increased by 300%. In our headquarters of San Antonio, Texas, even local organizations are at risk. A few weeks ago, Judson ISD payed a $500,000 ransom.In 2020, there were over 300,000 open roles for cybersecurity professionals in the US. To add to that, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts a 31% increase in Information Security roles in the upcoming years. As attacks are on the rise, the demand for cybersecurity professionals is quickly increasing. But with so many open roles, the issue isn’t demand – it’s supply.Luckily, San Antonio is already a national leader in cybersecurity. We have over 16,000 employees in the field, which is the most certified cyber professionals outside of D.C.. With industry giants like USAA and Lockheed Martin in the city, we have a good footing over much of the country. Moreover, San Antonio is Military City, USA. We’re home to one of the largest populations of bases, veterans, and active service members in the country. With both these backgrounds, the city is well positioned to continue to lead our country’s defense – not just traditionally, but in cyber warfare as well. But we still need more help. What can we do about it? Train more cybersecurity professionals. Organizations like Project Quest have supported cybersecurity training for years. But we can’t rely solely on non-profit funding. There are plenty of opportunities for veterans to enter the field with VA benefits. Training programs like Codeup Cloud Academy are approved to accept GI Bill® and Vocational Rehab. This allows veterans to receive housing support while getting the cybersecurity training they need in our Cyber Cloud program.Want to keep San Antonio safe and positioned as a leader in Cybersecurity? Help us train the next generation of cybersecurity professionals! Connect us with veterans in your network so we can all help continue San Antonio’s tradition of protecting our city and country!",[],[],[],[],True

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/why-do-lawyers-get-paid-the-big-money/,Why Do Lawyers Get Paid the Big Money? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsLawyers are compensated extremely well for the work that they do, but why is their pay so high, $250 per hour and beyond?Three reasons: 1) They have a skill with limited supply of people that can do it, 2) the difference between a mediocre and good lawyer is really apparent, and 3) they work on really important stuff (i.e., when people hire a lawyer, the job needs to be done right).Sound familiar? This why programmers get paid so well, too.1) Limited supply of peopleEven in our very own San Antonio, TX, there just are not enough programmers to meet the demand that employers have. They often have to look elsewhere in order to find people to fulfill their technology needs. A lot of programmers who are also homegrown here in San Antonio leave the city in order to find jobs elsewhere because they are not aware of all of the opportunity that lies here.  The United States is even giving foreign people with computer science backgrounds work visas to live in the US and offer their skills. Looking for a career in which you will always be needed? This is it.2) The difference between good and bad are apparentAny lawyer that tells you that a case is “a slam dunk” is a bad lawyer. Any lawyer that stumbles and fumbles through the law as if he or she were riding a unicycle on a rocky road is an awful lawyer. Any programmer that builds apps full of bugs and that crash every time you open them and calls it a finished product is a bad programmer. It is easy to tell the difference between something that is good and something that is awful, especially with computer programming. You know something is good when the program is doing what it is meant to do without issues. It feels flawless, which means a lot of hard work went into building it. However, like the examples above, bad lawyers and programming are quite apparent. Would you use Facebook as much if it worked like MySpace when MySpace was popular? Chances are you would not.3) They work on important thingsLook at your smartphone or tablet and think about all of the apps you use on a daily basis. Then, look at your laptop or desktop computer and think about all of the things you use those for. Now, look at your job and all of the software and technology necessary to keep you afloat, aware, and productive. Chances are that you rely heavily on technology on a day-to-day basis, and a lot of it is important for our lives, personally and professionally. Computer programmers, among others, are the people behind a lot of the things we take for granted every day. They work on important things, and they need to be paid well for it. You would not want to pay as little as possible for an architect to design your family’s home; why would you want a computer programmer to be paid very little to make your life much more frustrating with buggy and incomplete software?These are just three simple reasons why computer programmers, like lawyers, get paid a lot of money. It’s really about what they do and who they do it for.Right now is the best time to learn how to become a computer programmer and start getting paid well for doing important things.

http://www.therivardreport.com/codeup-what-is-the-value-of-an-education/,Codeup: What is the Value of an Education?,"San Antonio ReportLike many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans.But as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. It’s the bottom-line question: “How is this making me money, like, right now?”One of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “Boom! I got this!”Philosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?The weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley – who started the computer coding school Codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try.In less than two years he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now? Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup.“The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.”What does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate. I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the time value of money speech that you don’t want to hear again.With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can calculate what that amount is worth today by using a discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.I have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars.That discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K today. Another way of putting it is that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal. “The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.”So that’s interesting.We can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average.I mean, I’m sure they are.But still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke.How much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? Again, I don’t think it’s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of money in the future not being worth as much money today. Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career.But what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before. Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44. Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition.With those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: “What if I was to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?”Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.”Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Most important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens.But – and this is a big but – it’s not a crazy assumption. Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens.It’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-set-to-open-coding-school-in-dallas/,Codeup Set to Open Coding School in Dallas,"San Antonio ReportCodeup, a homegrown career school for aspiring software developers, is expanding to Dallas.The Houston Street immersive coding school for adults is taking its web development program to the Big D with plans to open a downtown Dallas campus in early 2020, CEO Jason Straughan told the Rivard Report Friday.The company announced in a blog post its intentions to launch in Dallas to serve a growing need for tech workers in the Dallas-Forth Worth metropolitan area. Pending approval from the Texas Workforce Commission, which regulates career schools and colleges in the state, Codeup is set to open in Dallas with an initial cohort of 24 students studying full-stack web development, which includes programming the design and behavior of a website as well as the underlying data and backbone of a website.As Straughan and the team at Codeup contemplated a potential expansion beyond state lines, the need to grow within it became clear, he said.“When you start looking at the needs of tech workers in Texas, it is just unbelievable and continues to grow,” he said. “Roughly 42 percent of all tech jobs are in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area.”The sheer demand in the DFW area has become increasingly apparent to Codeup as it has placed a tenth of its graduates in jobs there over the past year and a half, Straughan said. Despite being five hours away from San Antonio by car, Dallas remains within close enough proximity to the other four major cities in Texas that Codeup sees its new school in that city as an extension of the San Antonio campus, Straughan said.“If we were to go to Tampa, or if we had gone to Norfolk or gone to Kansas City, you’re officially opening a second Codeup,” he said. “But by staying in Texas and opening a campus in Dallas, we’re really just extending, we think, our San Antonio offering to another city.”Codeup has taken a different tack to growth than many of its national peers in the coding school space. Whereas contemporaries such as The Iron Yard and Dev Bootcamp focused their business on aggressive expansion in top tech markets, and subsequently shut down, Straughan said Codeup has chosen to hold off on expanding its footprint for the first seven years.After launching a data science boot camp this year, and growing its Downtown San Antonio space, Codeup set its sights on expanding outside of the city. Adding more classes and programming too quickly in San Antonio would have oversaturated the market, Straughan said.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Codeup has signed a lease at the historic Katy Building in Downtown Dallas, located at 701 Commerce St., and expects the Texas Workforce Commission to decide whether to approve the new school within the next few months.Nearly 100 students enrolled in Codeup’s most popular offering, a 20-week full-time program focused on web design and development, between September 2016 and August 2017, the most recent report published on the Texas Workforce Commission’s website. Just over 80 percent of those enrolled completed the 600-hour, $27,500 program, and close to three-quarters of them found related employment after graduating, according to the commission.",[],[],[],[],True

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-set-to-offer-data-science-program-beginning-in-february/,Codeup Set to Offer Data Science Program Beginning in February,"San Antonio ReportWeb development trade school Codeup has received approval from the Texas Workforce Commission to train aspiring data scientists during a new 18-week course.Data science is a growing profession in which demand for trained workers is high but supply is scarce, said senior data scientist Maggie Giust, whom Codeup hired to lead the instruction for the course.“Larger companies like H-E-B, Rackspace, and USAA are growing their data scienceIn 2012, the Harvard Business Review trumpeted data scientist as the “sexiest job of the 21st century” and postings for data scientists on job search site Indeed have risen sharply over the past several years.The University of Texas at San Antonio recently announced it is set to build a new School of Data Science, which will house all information technology-related academic programs, at its downtown campus as soon as the 2021-22 academic year.Jungle Disk and Quickpath Analytics are among the local employers who have shown interest in increasing the data scientist pipeline, said Dimitri Antoniou, Codeup’s director of business development.Mike DeFelice, who leads Jungle Disk’s data science operations and is the chief technology officer for fledgling insurance startup CyberFortress, said he met with Codeup several months ago to help build the data science curriculum from an employer’s perspective.The profession itself is still very young, and there are few standards to help employers hire for it, DeFelice said. If Codeup’s first two cohorts are successful, San Antonio will have as many as 50 new data scientists to help companies derive value from the massive amounts of data they have gathered over the years, he said.“I think … 50 new data-science-focused coders that can go and work in a company is just going to prove that we need more of them,” he said. “I think it’s a wonderful thing for San Antonio.”A data scientist uses a combination of computer programming, statistical analysis, and visualizations to take large data sets and make sense of them.Antoniou said he is expecting the entry-level salary for a data scientist graduating from Codeup to be “substantially higher” than an entry-level software developer’s.Although no technical experience is required to enroll in Codeup’s web development program – its advertising campaign touts students who have gone from working as coffee baristas to becoming software developers – a background in math, computer programming, or business is preferred for applicants looking to enter the data science program.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.“I believe somebody who’s hungry enough can train up on those things to get to a point where they can start our program,” Antoniou said. “But, more commonly, we’ll probably see people transitioning from a math undergraduate degree, work as a business analyst or software developer, or someone who already has some of that expertise built into their professional background.”The course costs $22,500. Codeup said it will refund half the tuition if a graduate does not find a job within six months.The course is scheduled to begin Feb. 4 with 25 students learning in one of three new classrooms built as part of Codeup’s recent expansion within the Vogue Building downtown. A second cohort is set to start in July.",[],[],[],[],True

I would highly recommend attending a CS bootcamp over the self-taught route to gain access to instructor-led lectures, an... Read More extensive professional network and benefit from academic support and better job prospects.Codeup, now known as a career accelerator, differentiates itself from the competition by providing a comprehensive instructor-led based course covering the Full-Stack (HTML, CSS, Javascript, MySQL, and Java/Java Boot) spanning 4.5 months as well as extensive professional career resources (resume, interview prep, and network growth), ensuring job placement for all of their students within a 6 months period post-graduation (Full-Tuition Refund otherwise). Most instructors at Codeup are highly competent, providing quality instruction. One advantage of being in downtown San Antonio while attending Codeup is access to San Antonio's growing tech community in the heart of downtown. Codeup provides all of its students with memberships to Geekdom (a workplace and startup incubator) where students take part in the many events happening in tech in SA.I have a few cons worth mentioning. Codeup is the most expensive bootcamp I know of personally totaling $22,500. However, Codeup offers their students many scholarship opportunities and is one of the very few bootcamps that accepts the GI bill. For some, Codeup's 9-5 instructor led classes is too long/structured. And finally, Industry valued frameworks like Angular or React aren't taught at Codeup.Finally, what I like best about Codeup is the challenge of delivering a comprehensive Full-Stack application to staff, friends, family, and recruiters the day of graduation after 2 and a half weeks of hard work on the capstone project. I cannot overstate the importance of completing TEAM projects throughout your Codeup or bootcamp experience. Recruiters love that!8/8/2018OverallCurriculumJob Support ""Honest review"" TLDR – No brainer for veterans using the GI Bill or Vocational Rehab. Personal Outcome – Hired with major tech organization. Cohort Outcome – 23/28 Graduated, 21/23 placed within 8 weeks of graduation.  I told myself that I wouldn’t write a review until... Read More I was employed and working. I didn’t want “honeymoon haze” to have an effect of skewing my thoughts on the experience as a whole. If you are reading this to decide if it’s worth your time or money, that depends on your personal financial situation. For a military veteran using the GI Bill or Vocational Rehab, it is absolutely worth every cent. Mostly because you’ll get paid to attend class and learn a skill worth having. If you’re paying out of pocket or through loans, that can be a much trickier proposition. Do not be fooled by the ridiculous starting salaries advertised by other boot camps. Those amounts easily equate to the average of ~$55k San Antonio offers. The primary reason for this is cost of living adjustment. So, if you think you’re going to make $80-$100k fresh out of Codeup with no prior experience or college degree, think again. In fact, due to the enormous talent pool of qualified candidates and limited number of positions, not having a college degree (regardless of field) can really hurt you in the San Antonio market. You have much less in the way of bargaining and have to consider the idea of taking a much lower than desired salary just to get the coveted experience companies crave. Engagement beyond graduation is more than you could ask for and also worth the investment. Follow-on cohorts may have a different experience, but my review is based off working with Stephen who was in charge of employer relations. On top of the volunteer opportunities, job fairs, workshops, and meetups, additional interviews were also coordinated by Stephen. He did everything in his power to find opportunities with employers. In total, I had 8 phone interviews and 5 in-person interviews. Out of the 5, I received offers from 2. I might’ve been able to secure an additional 2 offers, but my interviewing/negotiating skills were rusty and poorly researched (see above about salary expectations). The instructors at Codeup are the main reason to choose a structured approach versus self-taught. Having access to someone intimately familiar with the curriculum whenever you need pays dividends when trying to grasp tricky concepts. The instructors almost make you believe they are wizards with special membership rings that give them coding powers. But with that being said, it is important to curb your expectations. The instructors are experts on the curriculum they teach and their individual expertise outside of the curriculum. This means that trying to test them with obscure coding challenges that have zero relevance to the real world is utterly pointless. This leads into the curriculum. The curriculum is relatively up to date given the breakneck speed development moves. You will learn HTML, CSS, JS (ES5 and ES6), Java 8, Spring, MySQL, and a little bit of Bash. You will learn just enough of each of these to be dangerous, but not even close to mastery. You will find yourself asking why you’re using x framework, or y library, but the truth is, just do it. Development is complex enough as is, you don’t need to try to reinvent the wheel just to say that your project uses no libraries. As the projects get more difficult, no one gives a shit if you use jquery or lodash or bootstrap or whatever to make your project. As long as the final product is functional, feature complete, and relatively bug free, use whatever you can to save yourself time! With all of that being said, manage your expectations. Special wizard rings are not issued upon graduation. You will spend 4 months learning many dialects of many languages. Equate that to learning French, German, Arabic, Spanish, and Japanese in 4 months. Your level of mastery will be reflected in much the same way. You will gravitate towards one more than the other, and become more proficient the more you use it. At the end of the day, Codeup was well worth it for me and several of my cohort mates would agree.10/24/2015 Course  Full Stack Web Development - Java OverallCurriculumJob Support ""An Exceptional Program"" Codeup took me from complete coding beginner to developing full stack web apps in 4 months.

Read More bootcamp in July of 2015. While my experience in the part-time course probably differs greatly from the full-time course, the main pro was that the course focuses on professional skills, teaching new technologies and languages that are popular and in-demand. It's invaluable to interact with people working in the field to learn best practices, tricks and expectations once you are out working on your own.However, a major con is that it's a lot of learning condensed into a very short amount of time, and there's a lot of pressure on the individual to keep pace. The ""syllabus"" has a schedule of ""however long it takes to cover this topic,"" and I found that many in my class moved at very different paces. Another con is, because of the condensed timeframe, there's not a lot of time to practice each thing you learn. It's very much up to the individual how far into each topic they want to/are able to go. High levels of personal motivation and the willingness to persevere are a must.10/19/2015 Course  Full Stack Web Development - Java OverallCurriculumJob Support ""Educational"" Codeup was very helpful in getting me to the next stage of web development.

However, this brings me to the main pros of the class: the staff and support. At no time did I feel that the staff wasn't 100% dedicated to my success.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/why-isnt-the-san-antonio-tech-scene-growing-faster/,Why Isn't the San Antonio Tech Scene Growing Faster? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsThe simple answer is computer programming talent. These are the people that can take a business’ or customer’s requirements and create software products that solve their problems.  These people are at the apex of the tech ecosystem.  They don’t just maintain or configure, they imagine, design and create new things for technology to do.The symptoms are everywhere:• Established tech companies cannot hire. Rackspace has taken the significant step of creating the Open Cloud Academy to train people who can work entry-level Linux administration jobs. Sweb Development and Denim Group both opened satellite offices in other cities to recruit talent.  Rackspace opened a second Geekdom in San Francisco to get access to talent there.  Big tech companies are opening branch development offices in Austin or Chicago rather than here.• Startups cannot hire. One local startup recently hired a developer who had never worked in their chosen programming language. The choice of hiring a smart person to spend months learning a new skill or having no hire at all is an awful choice to make, but it is something we see all too often.• Entrepreneurs are not able to find their founding team. I run the San Antonio Tech Co-Founders Wanted meetup. We usually get about 20 people. At most, 1-2 are programmers. The rest are business and design people.• Graduates are leaving. I have spoken at the Computer Science departments at UTSA, Trinity, and St. Mary’s University this year. Many of the students I spoke with were planning to leave the city. Our brightest high school graduates are leaving, too. The officers of the computer society at UT Austin are most all San Antonio kids.We think the answer is making more of our residents programmers. More programmers means more people starting companies and those startups hiring more people. People who create companies that create more jobs for San Antonio are the ones we want to bring up and support.  (Don’t believe that a few tech startups can change a city for the better?  Just look at what the Rackspace founders have changed since they start 15 years ago.)My startup, Codeup, is part of the solution as are things like Open Cloud Academy from Rackspace and CodeHS at Highlands High School.However, there is more to be done. CodeHS is only in one school. Codeup’s first cohort will be less than 30 students. We are a drop in the bucket of what can be done to make high-tech, and the great careers it provides, as big of a component of the San Antonio economy as tourism and medicine.To get more programmers out there, we need to make their creation a focus at all levels of education. Programming competitions should be treated with the same celebration as multi-million dollar high school football programs. We should have magnet schools for programming like we do for health careers. We need to make high-tech in San Antonio from kindergarten through college our top priority.It’s possible.  Let’s get more programmers out there building a brilliant future for San Antonio.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

While our first class was 95% San Antonio residents, we’re now seeing over 50% of applicants from outside our fair city.This recent article from Silicon Hills News is pretty representative of this trend.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/the-college-financing-scam-and-how-were-doing-things-differently/,The College Financing Scam and How We're Doing Things Differently - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsHere’s the dirty secret of private college “financing” and how it really works. Private colleges first set a ridiculously high list price. Here’s my alma mater Lafayette College as an example. Their all-in cost per year now is $57,000 (food not included, sorry).Here’s the secret: most everyone doesn’t pay nearly that much. They get “financial aid.” The financial aid office studies each family’s finances, tax returns, and background and then uses a formula to determine financial aid and grants. In other words, they look to see the maximum that a family can afford and charge that amount.To repeat: colleges study how much you can possibly afford and then set the price for you. This is like a car dealer looking at your tax return and deciding how much you should pay for a car. That’s wrong.Of course, the department that looks at financial aid is a cost center for the school. Colleges have to hire financial aid assistants, governmental compliance managers, debt collectors, managers to manage the managers, and so on. Therefore, tuition has to be higher to pay for more staff to handle the amount of loans, aid, and financing that must be arranged. It’s a vicious cycle.For most colleges, the price that you pay is not only for the cost of your classes. You pay for everything else that the college has to offer, even if you do not use all of their services, such as their sports teams, gyms, luxury dormitories, etc. The rising cost of college is also affected by administrators with bloated salaries and inefficient spending, but not teacher salaries. For example, 42 college presidents made over $1 million in compensation in 2012. Additionally, many universities are having to spend millions on trying to attract more students to apply because they have to compete for students on a global scale.The result of this process is that the parents and students are forced to take out student loans that will take decades to pay off. We know tons of people who are saddled with student debt in their late 30s and early 40s.Young people graduate with tons of debt and no guarantee of a future. Is that the way education should work? We think that’s garbage.People ask if they can use government grants, conventional student loans, GI Bills, and other public or private financing sources. We say no because we don’t want to punish our students because the higher education system is fundamentally broken. If we join other educational institutions exploiting students and government funding, we’ll slowly become the bureaucratic mess they have become. Instead, we want to spend our time working to prepare our students.We think that higher-education needs a complete rethinking. Education should be tied to a future, not to a slip of paper. If an educational program wins while students lose, that is a failed institution and system.With Codeup, you get what you pay for. We put our money where our mouth is. We do not ask for government handouts. We do not saddle students with any debt until we get them a future. You win, we win. You lose, we lose.Students first, always, and that is how it should be.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/what-is-our-noble-cause/,What is Our Noble Cause? - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsIn his TEDx San Antonio presentation this fall, Nick Longo, co-founder of Geekdom, talked about finding one’s noble cause as a means of fulfilling an entrepreneurial spirit. I related to this topic because I love to come up with ideas and find ways to solve problems. “Ideation” is my top strength, according to Strengthsfinder. As I reflected on my noble cause, I looked back over the past several months, and it became clear to me that I was only addressing small problems, and I wasn’t considering the larger problems at my doorstep. I accepted certain norms that were problematic as unsolvable, defaulting to solving niche problems. I could have made money solving these niche problems, but that would be a small change on a big scale. I’d be putting out the embers rather than the raging flames in my community. My noble cause then became solving bigger problems to make a big impact, not just make money.The big issueIn my circles, I often engage in the discussion of hiring developers. “I just can’t find any good ones,” I would hear from business leaders. “I am right out of college, but I cannot build a website for the life of me,” university graduates would say. I would hear things like this from companies I have mentored at Geekdom, where we office, from friends running companies large and small, and from students looking for work.  The blaring issue that reared its ugly head was “Why does everyone have trouble hiring developers?” Most business owners and managers accept this as a fact of life; I decided to make this my noble cause and make a big impact.Getting busy with itWhen one finds that noble cause, it becomes one’s mission in life to see it come to fruition. As Nick Longo said, “Business is the mindset; entrepreneurship is the heartset.” The Codeup team stepped out of its comfort zone and went on a quest to provide some value to society. We took on the challenge of training new developers, giving people a meaningful second career, and we’re helping companies find great people to do awesome work. Our team, Jason, Chris, Samantha, and myself, are ready to make our corner of the world better by solving this big problem in our town, San Antonio, Texas, and in our country, one person at a time.Our mission continues beyond the classroom too. We’ve partnered with reputable companies who desire knowledgeable programmers to hire. We welcome other businesses in the San Antonio community who want to find great programmers who are anxious to get to work.Do you want to join us in this mission?

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/young-women-coding-laura-w/,Young Women Coding: Laura W. - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsWe are always excited to see someone doing something amazing on social media, especially if it is people learning how to code and participating in competitions. We also love hearing about people and organizations looking to bridge the gender gap in the tech industry.We were recently contacted by a woman who wanted to talk to us about her daughter, Laura W. Laura had participated in National Center for Women and Information Technology Aspirations in Computing Award. The purpose of the contest is to “build a talent pool for the growing technical workforce and help academic and corporate organizations celebrate diversity in computing by honoring young women at the high-school level for their computing-related achievements and interests.”Laura was a runner-up for the competition, which is quite impressive seeing how there were 350 applicants from around the country. She was introduced to the competition via the Girls Who Code program, which is an eight week summer program where she learned how to code in languages, such as Scratch, JavaScript, C, Python, JQuery Mobile, and HTML/CSS. Girls Who Code works to bridge the gender gap in technology through immersive summer programs that introduce young women to computer programming.“During the eight weeks, I learned something that I had never even heard about: coding,” she said in an email. “After being introduced to coding, I feel like it is a part of my life and is something that is really important to me and should be even more important to other young women.”Women make up roughly 12% of the hires in the tech industry, according to Lauren Bacon, cofounder of Raised Eyebrow Web Studio. When asked about the problem of the lack of women in the industry, Laura states that she thinks there are not many women in programming because “they feel they are intimidated by boys.” There is truth in what she says; the tech industry has been a boys’ club for a while. We’d like to see that change.We’re very proud to see more young women finding their passion in computer technology, and we’d like to see Laura be successful in the industry in the future! Thanks for talking with us, Laura, and good luck!Remember, we do offer scholarships to women for every class.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/why-people-cant-learn-programming-on-their-own/,Why People Can't Learn Programming on Their Own - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup NewsWhile developing Codeup, we interviewed dozens of people who attempted to learn programming on their own. We wanted to delve into their experience to uncover lessons learned.  We discovered the self-taught method was done with good intentions but the result was unfortunately failure. Here are some of the reasons it didn’t work out.1.  Beginning pointOur interviewees really didn’t know where to start. The topic of technology is huge, so determining a beginning point was difficult. Most people don’t know what to learn first. One person told us she started with Java, a popular programming language. Although it’s widely used, it’s difficult to learn. I know because I wrote four books on it.2.  Online resources suckComputers and online lessons stink at teaching anything complex. If you can’t understand a topic, your only option for clarification is to have the online resource explain it to you again the exact same way. That doesn’t work at advancing your knowledge. What is beneficial to your learning is having a live instructor understand your thought process so that he/she can customize the instruction for you. In programming, concepts build on one another. For each concept you learn, the preceding topic must be understood. If you’re missing a core concept, you won’t understand the next one.3.  Lack of focusComputer programming is intense. We discovered that people lose their focus because the topic is not easily absorbed. It takes time to learn and practice programming, a big investment that some are not willing to make long-term. Some think they can learn it within a weekend or at night, but that approach only sets them up for failure. Another reason people lose their focus is because life gets in the way.4.  Single mindedOne is a lonely number when you’re learning on your own. Lessons learned in solitude are not beneficial because there is only one perspective — yours.  People get more out of instruction when they learn in groups – the one thing the current education system gets right.  Peers within groups motivate others to perform better.  Having individuals as part of a group instantly creates a community where everyone is traveling the same journey.5.  Reasons to learnFor most people, learning programming had no clear endpoint. They had difficulty envisioning life after the lesson. Do I really get a job? Am I building something meaningful? Having invested a lot of time and energy on programming, people started to question “Why am I doing this?”The Codeup model addresses these issues in a learning system we’ve developed into a single, intense 9-week boot camp with live instructors. Students finish with a Hiring Day where they demonstrate a live, production-ready application to show prospective employers.We want to teach you about programming, so you can put this skill to work to improve your life and those of others.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/where-kids-can-learn-to-code-in-san-antonio/,Where Kids Can Learn to Code in San Antonio - Codeup,"Aug 14, 2018 | Codeup News Programming can be fun for kids and helps develop essential skills they’ll be using their whole lives. According to a study on the cognitive effects of learning and computer programming, when kids learn how to program, they’re not just learning a programming language, they’re “gaining powerfully general higher cognitive skills such as planning abilities, problem-solving heuristics, and reflectiveness on the revisionary character of the problem solving process itself.” Through learning code, kids are learning to learn. Coding will be an important skill for the next generation, who will be more connected to the web than any of their predecessors. Here are a few great programs for kids and teens in San Antonio:San Antonio Youth Code Jam is an annual, semi-unstructured event backed by the 80/20 Foundation, Rackspace Hosting, SAStemic and other sponsors that help keep this event free. Kids bring their own laptops and other tech gear to have a day of code exploration. A collaborative environment allows kids to meet other kids who like the same things they do while learning from each other. Webmaking and digital literacy are developed through fun drag-and-drop games or more involved personal projects. Until the next event, check out their list of digital resources.Branching off of the regular Codeup programs, Codeup Teens gives high school students the chance to learn something often left out of traditional school curriculum. Every 4th Saturday of the month at Geekdom they can get an afternoon of instruction with the Codeup staff. Students usually work on web technologies like JavaScript or Scratch, but the team will always make accommodations based on the student’s skill set. TurnerLogic CodeKids runs a similar program for middle school students.SAStemic is vital to San Antonio’s technology environment. They advocate to fill the wide spread need for STEM education in schools and communities. Initiatives like Geekbus provide a traveling makerspace filled with 3D printers, robotics, and other electrons for exploring. Schools get access to STEM experiences without having to buy equipment or leave the classroom. Other programs prepare students for national competitions like the National Youth Cyber Defense Competition and the Alamo First robotics competition. Hopefully with continued efforts from SAStemic, San Antonio will see strong STEM programs in every school.The tech community continues to give opportunities specifically for women; Girls Inc. inspires little ladies to pick up a computer and start writing code. They just kicked off a program in San Antonio partnering with Made with Code to give San Antonio girls a safe place in an industry dominated by boys. In a collaborative space, girls make friends, code 3D printed bracelets, and program avatars to dance across their screens.Teaching kids to code enables youth to learn the process of learning itself, which puts them at a huge advantage amongst their peers in continuing education. With programs for every gender, tech savvy level, and age group alike, there are so many opportunities for kids in San Antonio to start coding.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

As a career accelerator, both begin with our state regulators, the Texas Workforce Commission, through which we are licensed as a Texas Career School. To ensure we are delivering on our promises, we submit annual outcomes reports that summarize program completion and post-graduation employment rates for the period of September through August. These are reviewed and published through the state on an annual basis for the previous year.Unfortunately, every state has different regulatory procedures, which means bootcamps all over the country report, are reviewed, and publish differently. Ultimately, this impacts students negatively by reducing transparency, clarity, and accessibility of those numbers. Some bootcamps report employment rates for subsets of their graduates, while others publish for only specific time periods. To bridge this gap, Codeup has teamed up with Ascent Funding and the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting to improve transparency in results reporting so students can make informed decisions. As a voluntary measure to improve transparency, Codeup submits two reports, conducts an external audit, and publishes through CIRR twice each year.If you have more questions about outcomes reporting, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-grads-released-general-population-2/,Codeup Grads Released Into General Population,"San Antonio ReportWhat can one person achieve in three months?  How about embarking on a future in one of the fastest growing industries in the country?Codeup is an intense, 11-week web programming bootcamp that accelerates students with often zero development experience into coding powerhouses ready for the open and growing job market.  According to U.S. News and World Report, web developers earned a median salary of $62,500 in 2012, a number that is growing each year as supply continued to trail demand. With the exponentially expanding tech market hitting its stride in San Antonio, Codeup students are groomed for immediate placement in the job market.The very first Codeup class crossed the finish line Tuesday afternoon during “Demo Day” at the Briscoe Western Art Museum. Demo Day is essentially a market-oriented graduation exercise. Instead of standing in a line waiting for diplomas, Codeup classmates present personal and group projects (capstones) they have been working on during their three-month course. With luck, their future bosses are in the audience listening.Students, mentors, and business recruiters gathered for the people pitches and to congratulate Codeup grads and network with them about job opportunities.Each capstones project was presented by a three-student group, each one tasked from conceptualization to a fully-functioning web application in a deadline-driven, 10-day period.One project, Local Care Package (Leslie Tolbert, Ken Priest, and Brandon Beidel) offered a curated box full of “picks from a local” for those that are new in town and want to see what our city has to offer.Attention getting presentations like M.B. Athletes (Andres Dunn, Orlanda Villasenor, and Dylan Yoowitaya-Peralta) is a scouting tracker for military student athletes stationed in other parts of the world where recruiters often cannot make the trip.  M.B. Athletes concept gives the recruiter, coach, student, and family a way to connect through a sophisticated web design with profiles and videos tracking the athlete’s every statistic.Each project was well-conceived and properly delivered.  Serious work was put into each presentation and each group had lots to show.  It’s easy to imagine these projects, with more time and work, becoming successful startups one day.Codeup takes an often overlooked, unconventional approach to education.  For starters, students who don’t receive a job offer within six months of finishing Codeup get half of their tuition reimbursed. Tuition was about $8,000 for the inaugural class but will be adjusted to $9,850 for the next batch after Codeup Founder Michael Girdley adjusts for realized course costs. Girdley talked with me about the shift of local education, entrepreneurship and most importantly, the future of his students.“We believe an educational institution should only profit if and only if it provides results,” he said.What initially feels like a leap into darkness for 28 daring students, Codeup is confident its teachings will help students become candidates for employment in the space of 11 weeks.“The conventional education system is leaving people with tons of inescapable debt and usually no future,” Girdley said. “One applicant had a four-year degree and the best job he could find was selling timeshares at the mall. Disgusting.”Mitch Connell, one of the students enrolled in Codeup’s inagural class, is a 43-year-old former construction worker with 20 years experience. Connell  heard about CodeUp through a story on Texas Public Radio..“Right away, it clicked and I thought, that’s what I want to do,” he said.Connell  described his time at Codeup as “intense, but rewarding.  It’s like learning four different languages all at once, and none of them use the English alphabet.“On a personal level, I wanted to challenge myself and prove that I wasn’t too old to learn something completely new,” he said. “It was a risk, and I definitely had moments where I questioned myself. Now that the program is over, I can look back and feel proud of what I accomplished and learned.”Employers from more than 90 businesses were in attendance, most of which were looking to hire recruits immediately. Major employers, including H-E-B and Rackspace, were in attendance.Mary Valdez of H-E-B was asked about about the value of Codeup hosting an event to connect graduates with potential employers.“Codeup drives students who have a passion for what they really want to do and gives students the foundation to build on their skill levels when they enter the workplace,” she said.I also spoke with Brian Aleman from ManTech, an international cyber security company with an office located near the San Antonio International Airport. Until recently, Aleman recruited mainly from California because of a lack of local applicants.“It’s exciting to see local talent who is interested in coding, learning more, and working on some really cool stuff,” Aleman said. “California used to be the only place jobs like this existed, now it is right here and it’s growing.”San Antonio District 1 Councilman Diego Bernal arrived to support the class as they emerge into the San Antonio job market.  I asked Bernal about the future of technology in our expanding downtown environment:Scott Ball: With the tech push currently happening in San Antonio with businesses like Google Fiber and Rackspace setting up shop here in San Antonio, how can we lure these companies to locate in the downtown area?Diego Bernal: This is where they want to be because the employees that they naturally have don’t want to be in suburbia, they want to be where the action is, they want to be where the city is, where the culture and art is, and they want to be around each other. There is something to be said about an ecosystem of companies like the ones you just mentioned. Downtown is a natural place for that and you are finding that happening.  I think the folks at Rackspace are probably trying to figure out a way how to migrate down here if we are being honest.SB: Codeup is thriving after their first successful bootcamp.  How do you as a public figure play a role in a new local tech companies success?Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.DB: Part of my job is to make sure that people here and other places know that it exists.  The success of Codeup speaks for itself, this is sort of like the tech industry’s version of the science fair and all of the projects are blue ribbon, and it’s really amazing.  We can help with this exposure and let other folks know that endeavors like this are absolutely supported and encouraged, and welcomed by the city. We as a city government want to see more of it and we will do everything we can to help bring them here, but beyond that, since Codeup is here, our number one priority is that we fortify it.Codeup’s ideal student, Girdley said, is  “motivated and committed.”It is apparent that the entire first class embodies these two identifying qualities. Housed at the startup offices of Geekdom the path the students originally chose to take has changed during their time at Codeup.“This Codeup class entered with only a handful wanting to be entrepreneurs,” Girdley said. “Over time with us, they’ve seen they now have a power they didn’t see before.”Codeup teaches code, but it’s evident it also imbues students with a new level of confidence. A supportive staff confident the graduates will find good jobs add to that sense of positive energy, and the co-working Geekdom space incubates like-minded individuals with aspirations to elevate themselves through technology. It’s an impressive start by an impressive startup.*Featured/top image: Codeup Founder Michael Girdley and Chris Turner pose on the Codeup DeLorean during the Codeup Demo Day April 22, 2014.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-what-is-the-value-of-an-education/?share=email,Codeup: What is the Value of an Education?,"San Antonio ReportLike many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans.But as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. It’s the bottom-line question: “How is this making me money, like, right now?”One of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “Boom! I got this!”Philosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?The weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley – who started the computer coding school Codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try.In less than two years he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now? Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup.“The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.”What does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate. I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the time value of money speech that you don’t want to hear again.With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can calculate what that amount is worth today by using a discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.I have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars.That discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K today. Another way of putting it is that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal. “The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.”So that’s interesting.We can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average.I mean, I’m sure they are.But still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke.How much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? Again, I don’t think it’s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of money in the future not being worth as much money today. Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career.But what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before. Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44. Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition.With those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: “What if I was to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?”Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.”Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Most important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens.But – and this is a big but – it’s not a crazy assumption. Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens.It’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It’s an assumption that markets are somewhat efficient.  It’s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employers and work situations just like other people.All of which makes me pretty confident that the financial return on a skills upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 times the upfront tuition cost.As I said before, education leads to more sparkling conversations as well as to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt.But I appreciate my friend Girdley’s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 times multiple of your investment. Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in?Codeup Creates Free Teen Programming ClassesCodeup Grads Released Into General PopulationCodeup Creates Crowdfunding Tuition ProgramNo Corner Offices at The New GeekdomJumping the Corporate Ship into a Sea of Startups",[],[],"[('that', 'measure')]",[],True
https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-creates-crowdfunding-tuition-program-2/,Codeup Creates Crowdfunding Tuition Program,"San Antonio ReportCodeup is a for-profit educational startup in San Antonio that takes people from non-techie to full fledged hirable programmer in 12 weeks. Created by entrepreneur and startup investor Michael Girdley, the programming boot camp not only teaches students the skills employers need today through constant mentorship and hands-on training, but helps connect them to partnering employers both at graduation and afterwards.But it ain’t cheap. At $9,850 the program is worth roughly half of a nice new car. The price is by no means bad for a programming boot camp – a similar 12-week program at Austin’s MakerSquare would cost $13,880 and San Francisco’s Hack Reactor runs you $17,780 – but for some, it’s still a significant economic barrier. Full and part time jobs are almost certainly out of the question, because between all-day classes and homework, students are looking at about 60 hours of coursework per week.That’s why Codeup just launched a tuition crowdfunding portal where students can crowdfund some or all of their tuition. The simple site takes you directly to the student profile page where participating students have a video to promote themselves and a brief description of where they will go with their programming education.Users can pledge between $25 and $1,000 by credit card and also can promote their recipient student’s fundraising campaign on social media with the click of a button. Four students accepted for the coming semester already have created crowdfunding profiles, which will be up for a month, and more students may join if the model proves effective.Girdley got the idea for a crowdfunding tuition model after talking to friend and Geekdom Manager and 80/20 Foundation Executive Director Lorenzo Gomez about Kiva.org – a global microloan site.“One of the things that is really powerful about Geekdom is that I have the best conversations when I am walking to get coffee with people or talking about issues that are happening,” Gridley said. “That was one of the conversations I had with Lorenzo, so we went and pursued it.”“This is the future of tuition and paying for your school in my opinion,” Gomez said. “You can go and spend $30,000 on a degree. There’s nothing wrong with that option. But if you need to acquire a skill in a timely fashion and get working right away you can now go to a 12-week boot camp, crowdsource to get some or all of the tuition you need, and then go through and get life-altering skills taught to you in a compressed amount of time.”The crowdfounding option is great for recently accepted Codeup student Jonathan Robinson, who would have had to go into debt to take advantage of the program.“I would have had to take out some extra loans,” Robinson said. “There is an opportunity to pay for it up front but it would put me in greater debt because I am still paying off student loans. I’m using the crowdfunding to help supplement my cost.”Robinson has a degree in business marketing from Hampton University. After saving some money, he left his sales job at San Antonio medical company Medtronic to try and build a programming career with Codeup.“It’s a growing job opportunity and companies are looking for it. Here in San Antonio they are trying to become a tech area so you want to make sure you are ahead of the game and not trying to play catch-up,” Robinson said. “It’s the opportunity I’ve been waiting for and I’m just ready to get started with it.”Codeup launched its first programming boot camp on Feb. 3 of this year. The inaugural class is now in the final three weeks and will graduate April 22. This first class, as a kind of experiment, was originally scheduled for 8 weeks and cost $8,000, but adjustments to lesson, practice length and material/instructor costs had to be made.Their graduation ceremony at The Briscoe Western Art Museum will be a kind of “reverse job fair,” where employers will attend and approach any candidates they might like to hire.The second boot camp, which will benefit from the crowdfunding campaign, will begin on May 6 and has 15 of 30 seats available. Getting accepted is a competitive process as Girdley has already received 70 student applications and expects to receive quite a few more before filling the class.Codeup boot camps mainly focus on web development and cover Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript. Camps also features visits from tech industry professionals who speak on a variety of entrepreneurial topics and help students network. The course curriculum was created as a direct response to the needs of the local tech community and Codeup has hiring partnerships with 55 startups and larger tech companies who have agreed to consider hiring Codeup graduates. In fact, Girdley is so confident that Codeup will find students employment that he offers a guarantee: Students not offered a job within six months of completing the course will get half their tuition back.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.While the true results of the first Codeup class, and the job opportunities that result, will not be known until after the April 22 graduation, Girdley is not shy about his dislike of traditional higher education system, and he wants to turn the whole system on its head to better educate tech professionals.“If you look at everything we are doing, it’s exactly the opposite of how classical education is done,” Girdley said. “You look at a college or a job training program and the first thing they try to do is saddle people with a whole bunch of debt. We don’t want to do that. If you look at their instructors, they hang out with you for an hour or two hours a couple days a week. Our instructors are with you for over 700 hours — all day every day as a group with the students. College is usually one professor and 30 students. We have seven instructors in a class of 28 … and the cool thing is, you come talk to our students and they’ll tell you it’s totally working.”Codeup is still accepting applications for both the May 6 and August 5 boot camps.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-creates-free-teen-programming-classes/,Codeup Creates Free Teen Programming Classes,"San Antonio Report“Give a man a computer program and he’ll eat for a day. Teach the man computer programming and he’ll eat for a lifetime and start his own tech company.” I think that’s how the saying goes.Teaching people to code is the sole mission of Geekdom startup Codeup, which has created a crash course in computer programming to take hard-working individuals from non-techie to hirable programmer in only 12 weeks.(Read More: Codeup Grads Released Into General Population)While that program is for paying adults, Codeup is now launching a free weekend program to teach coding to teens in high school.The program is called Codeup Teens and will provide  free, two-hour programming classes on the last Saturday of every month at Geekdom of San Antonio on the 10th floor of the Weston Centre. Each session will be held from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and will enroll about 25 students. The first class begins June 28. Students can RSVP at the Codeup Teens webpage, filling seats on a first-come-first-serve basis.“The goal is to raise overall computer literacy, and hopefully more kids will grow up and want to be in good programming jobs, rather than have lower aspirations for less demanding jobs,” Codeup founder Michael Girdley said.Girdley decided to create Codeup Teens after seeing the huge turnout of San Antonio teens for the Schools Out Hackathon, or SoHacks, which was held last weekend at Rackspace Hosting. The event drew a huge crowd of San Antonio teens, many of whom were interested in programming despite their lack of access to a personal computer, or laptop. Because of this, many teens waited in long lines at the event to borrow one of the available laptops so they could participate and start learning to program.“We just see that there is a great opportunity for us to give back to the community – to expose more people to something that could really change their life rather than doing menial labor or what they might have otherwise considered doing,” Girdley said. “It (SoHacks) opened our eyes up to the number of kids in San Antonio, especially teens, that don’t have exposure to this stuff either through school or at home and we want to help with that.”Codeup Teens is open to any teen either in high school or entering high school this fall, and the skills taught at each weekend session will depend on each student’s previous knowledge of programming. Novices will be introduced to MIT’s Scratch, an online drag-and-drop program that teaches programming fundamentals while teens who have already had some programming experience can try learning JavaScript. Laptops for the program will be provided by San Antonio non-profit VentureLab and each class will be taught by former and current Codeup students and Codeup staff volunteers. If the first few events are successful and have good turnout, Girdley may widen the scope of the program.“Entrepreneurship is all about experimentation, so social entrepreneurship is the same thing. We’re starting with this, and then we’ll see what magic happens,” Girdley said.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city.

The startup has already graduated its first boot camp and is in the last six weeks of its second camp.According to Girdley, 23 of the 27 students who entered the inaugural class have already found employment as a programmer – which is good, because Codeup offers an employment guarantee for graduates who can’t find a job after six months, entitling them to half of their tuition back. The next available bootcamp starts Aug. 5 and is still accepting applications.

https://sanantonioreport.org/women-take-on-san-antonio-tech-leadership-roles-at-rackspace-codeup/,"Women Take On Leadership Roles at Rackspace, Codeup","San Antonio ReportIt’s been a good week for women in technology.Two San Antonio-based companies, Rackspace and Codeup, announced that top leadership positions were filled by female veterans of the tech industry.Carla Piñeyro Sublett, who was previously Rackspace’s CMO of the Americas region and the executive director of marketing for Dell’s Latin America region, has been promoted to senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Rackspace.Kay Jones, who worked at Rackspace for 11 years, most recently as senior manager of workforce planning and organizational development, is the new CEO of Codeup, a coding bootcamp.Both women are proud to be leaders in their companies, and both remain steadfast in their desire to advance women’s roles in the tech industry and beyond.During her 16 years at Dell, Carla Piñeyro Sublett saw the small company morph into a worldwide computer supplier. Her transition from Dell to Rackspace, she said, had the potential to be difficult, but her experience as director of marketing for Latin America at Dell prepared her well. She’ll be overseeing marketing functions for the hosting company worldwide.“Working in an emerging market was like working in a mid-size business at times,” Piñeyro Sublett told the Rivard Report. “The transition to Rackspace was like working at Dell in the beginning.”Piñeyro Sublett sees her new position as a way to improve Rackspace in key regions like Latin America, where it can grow to dominate the cloud-based competition.“There are tons of opportunities for Rackspace. We have a global footprint, so I think that having a global perspective is super important to growth,” she said.With Piñeyro Sublett’s promotion, the Rackspace leadership team includes 11 women, or about 14% of total leadership roles, Christina Weaver, a Rackspace spokeswoman, confirmed in an email. The company’s overall female employment is 23%.Piñeyro Sublett, who sits on The Texas Conference for Women board, sees mentoring as the the biggest responsibility females leaders have to younger generations of women.“I’m one of several really strong female leaders at Rackspace. They are strong role models in the community and internally (at Rackspace),” Piñeyro Sublett said. “This position comes with the responsibility of being a role model. We have to lift up other women within our communities.”After just over a decade at Rackspace as senior manager of workforce planning, Kay Jones was looking for a new way to participate in the San Antonio tech scene. Without realizing it at the time, she was also looking for a way to work downtown.“I probably hadn’t really experienced downtown San Antonio in eight years. In coming back now, there’s such a dramatic difference in just the vibe, and the atmosphere,” Jones said. “When I had the opportunity to meet with Codeup, it was just a beautiful fit between one thing I love, which is education and advancing adult learners, and the other thing I love, which is urban development. That spark between the two was just such a great fit that I couldn’t bring myself to turn away from it.”But Jones knows that the downtown tech scene grew from the hard work of city leaders and the tech community, and it’s what made her stay San Antonio instead of moving to Austin.“It’s been amazing to see this group of leaders really step up and say, ‘We want to see this city change for the better without losing its identity,’” she said.Jones said that her early years at Rackspace gave her a strong sense of her direct impact on the lives of employees, but as the company grew, she lost a little bit of that impact.“I had 2,500 people under my organizational purview (at Rackspace), and here (at Codeup) I feel like maybe I can actually get my hands into the inner workings of the startup,” Jones said. Codeup, founded in 2014, is a much smaller company. “I think so much of my desire was to take this huge body of knowledge that I was able to gather from Rackspace … and to translate it into a company that has a similar mission to change lives and to help people.”Michael Girdley, current board member and former CEO of Codeup, said that the search for the new CEO began with a focus on diversity.“As we went on the hunt to find the right person, we wanted to continue to diversify tech, so my first choice was a female CEO,” Girdley said. “For us, if we’re going to talk so much about (diversity), then we’re going to do it.”Girdley said that his decision to find a new CEO was based in a realization that as Codeup has grown, the company needed a CEO who can develop employee talent.“The company is growing, and as more students are going through (Codeup) and more processes are being put in place, the company needs different people at different stages,” Girdley said. “There are people like Kay who are going to put those processes in place and are going to do a better job of that than I could.”Female students currently make up 26% of students at Codeup, but Jones is not satisfied with that number. Despite her pride in the student diversity at Codeup, she hopes that her presence at the helm of will continue to have a positive impact.“I believe that we will actually be able to get little bit more ‘oomph’ out of our population,” Jones said with a laugh. “I anticipate that we’re going to see a little bit of an upswing in the number of female participants.”Marina Gavito is the executive director of Tech Bloc, a tech industry advocacy organization, and a past colleague of Jones. She said Jones is a “people leader,” a trait that is difficult to find in the tech industry.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.“She is extremely passionate about helping San Antonio build the tech ecosystem,” Gavito said. “Codeup is already going down a good path in the coding bootcamp space. Knowing Kay and her abilities, she’s going to hit the ground running and take them to next level.”Gavito said that Jones, as a female CEO in tech — something that is still unusual — has people rooting for her.“I love that she’s in this role. She is a strong leader regardless of (being) male or female. I’m personally happy because here we see a woman leader in tech doing something,” Gavito said. “I’m excited to watch what she’s going to do next.”For Jones though, her stake in this position is a little more personal.“I can’t say that there isn’t a part of me that just really feels compelled to ensure my success and the success of women in general. I have a 13-year-old daughter and I need her to know that she can do absolutely anything she desires to do,” Jones said.As a woman in a leadership role in tech, Jones said she carries the burden of being invested in both her family and her work life. Despite its many challenges, she asserts that women can do it, and they can do it extremely well.“You can fulfill both sides of your life in a really powerful way if you have the willingness to go a little outside of your comfort zone and try something new and invest yourself deeply in what you’re doing,” she said.*Top Image: Codeup CEO Kay Jones.

https://sanantonioreport.org/commentary-codeups-new-institute-aims-to-reinvent-college/,Commentary: Codeup's New Institute Aims to Reinvent College,"San Antonio ReportWe live in a global, technology-driven economy and workforce where, in the words of Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and famous investor, “software is eating the world.”Don’t believe me? Below is a sample of the world’s largest and fastest growing companies by category:Bookseller – AmazonNetflixiTunes, Spotify, and PandoraGoogle and GrouponSkypeLinkedInWhat do all of these businesses have in common? They are software companies. And the list doesn’t stop with these more obvious examples. Many companies in traditional industries, such as banking and insurance, also see themselves as evolving technology companies.However, in the midst of this age of technological progress, I regularly hear from executives of startups and corporations that we, as a society, are not creating high-skill technology talent with the necessary job-ready abilities at a scale to drive productivity and innovation.And I’m concerned that this problem likely will not be solved in the current, traditional education environment.The ability for someone to pursue higher education in any field is becoming a challenge, particularly because of financial barriers. Rising costs of college tuition either prevent college attendance entirely or lead to significant student loan debt.How are we going to solve these challenges?I’ve recently joined the team at Codeup, a computer programming school for mid-career changers and veterans in downtown San Antonio, as vice president of education to tackle these challenges. Our answer to the pressing higher education challenges is Codeup Institute.Through Insitute, we aim to revolutionize higher education access, success, and career readiness in computer science.Codeup Institute is a two-year, automated software engineering apprenticeship powered by a self-directed, peer-to-peer learning model for recent high school graduates. Codeup Institute’s mission is straightforward: graduate talented software engineers and technologists with the knowledge, experience, and skills to excel in the Digital Age.Its education model, “Empowered Education,” fuses three fundamental learning concepts: a challenge-based curriculum, peer-to-peer learning, and a student-driven education. Adapted from the internationally renowned Ecole 42 in Paris, France, Codeup Institute eliminates the high costs associated with instructors and student-purchased textbooks while adding the value that accrues from a rigorous, peer-to-peer learning environment.Codeup Institute students spend two years in-person at our downtown campus intensely focused on learning top-notch programming skills. Through an approach that blends a comprehensive computer science foundation with applied, industry-related skills (mobile and web development), Codeup Institute will bridge the gap between higher education and industry needs.From the first day of class, students will be assigned programming challenges of escalating difficulty and will solve them using open-source online resources, their fellow students, and Codeup Institute’s knowledgeable mentors. While nearly everything a student needs to learn about programming can be found on the Internet, at no cost, motivation is the single greatest barrier to pushing through the content and acquiring the necessary skills and theoretical foundation needed in technology careers. As such, the concept of peer-facilitated learning is fundamental at Insitute.The atmosphere of authentic teamwork and collaboration develops essential soft skills, such as grit and creative problem-solving acumen, which contribute to professional success. As a support network, 23 programmers (to date) from companies across San Antonio have signed on to invest their time and passion for coding as mentors for Institute.Tuition is $10,000 a year ($1,250 a year for students from a household income of less than $40,000); 100% financing is available for all students who qualify. As a first-generation college graduate with student loans, I feel that financial accessibility for those historically unable to enter/complete college is an incredibly impactful component of Codeup Institute. I wholeheartedly believe in Codeup Institute’s value to establish higher education access and success as the norm, not the exception, and it starts by tackling the cost of higher education.I’m working with Jason Straughan, Chris Turner and Michael Girdley, the three co-founders of Codeup computer programming bootcamp. Codeup results are impressive: 96% of graduates are employed within six months. The average graduate is making $45,000 right out of the program, on a trajectory to earn the nationwide mean for a web developer of $90,000. On average, graduates increase their earnings by $13,000 as a result of the program.Codeup Institute will not only increase social and economic mobility of San Antonio’s most valuable resource – its people – but be an economic engine for the city by producing employable software engineers.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.According to the University of California, Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti in “The New Geography of Jobs,” each high-skill technology job creates five other jobs outside the technology industry. Also, according to “The Hidden STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) Economy” by the Brookings Institution, “More STEM-oriented metropolitan economies perform strongly on a wide variety of economic indicators, from innovation to employment. Job growth, employment rates, patenting, wages, and exports are all higher in more STEM-based economies.”If you’re an individual, government, or business looking for a meaningful, strong return on investment, look no further than the field of computer science.What would cause Google to open an office – not in Austin, New York, or Chicago – but in San Antonio?

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-what-is-the-value-of-an-education/,Codeup: What is the Value of an Education?,"San Antonio ReportLike many, I see education from a combination of angles. Unquestionably, education makes us broader thinkers and more sparkling conversationalists. Education makes us more actualized humans.But as a finance guy, a small evil part of me always applies the $64,000 Wall Street question to every activity – from brushing my teeth to tossing a ball with a (in my case, non-existent) dog. It’s the bottom-line question: “How is this making me money, like, right now?”One of the problems of education, generally, is that we have a hard time proving or quantifying its value. What is the value of holding your shoulders back and head high when you walk into a job interview, knowing you’re the best they’re going to interview that week? Or the value of the feeling, when given a work assignment, of “Boom! I got this!”Philosophically, how can you put a value on just knowing more stuff?The weird thing about my friend Michael Girdley – who started the computer coding school Codeup – is that he’s ambitious enough to say that the education community tradition of waving a hand at hard-to-measure fuzzy feelings is not good enough. Just because the education community finds it difficult to measure value doesn’t mean that business people shouldn’t try.In less than two years he’s established a pattern of tracking data on the most important finance question of education. By that, I mean the bottom-line question: How is this making me money, like, right now? Girdley shared with me the pre-Codeup and post-Codeup earnings of his students, along with some useful stats on entry-level and mid-career web developer salaries.Using a couple of his statistics, I want to take a stab at figuring out the total value, right now, of a student’s investment in Codeup.“The average Codeup graduate saw her annual salary jump $13,035 in the year after graduation from the program.”What does that really mean? What can you do with that number if you plan, say, 30 working years at this higher salary?It would be great to say that a Codeup education is worth 30 times $13,035, or $391,050. However, money in the future is not as valuable to me as money today, so that calculation is not quite accurate. I mean, you could figure it, but finance guys will give you the time value of money speech that you don’t want to hear again.With a salary increase of just $13,035, we can calculate what that amount is worth today by using a discounted cashflow formula. So let’s be sophisticated and apply our discounted cashflow formula to 30 years of earnings, elevated by $13,035.I have to assume a “discount rate,” which is some combination of taking into account inflation and future investment risks. I’m going to assume a 5% discount rate. Using my 5% discount rate, I estimate the value today of my elevated salary to be $200,379.90. That’s the sum of 30 years’ worth of $13,035, but “discounted,” or translated back, into today’s dollars.That discounting allows us to more accurately compare the $16,000 tuition for Codeup with the total financial value, today, of that education. By that measure, you pay Codeup $16K today for something worth on average, $200K today. Another way of putting it is that you are buying something today worth 12.5 times that amount. With these numbers, Codeup sounds like pretty good deal. “The average web developer, nationally, earns $91,750. That’s $61,525 more than the average pre-Codeup salary of surveyed Codeup students.”So that’s interesting.We can imagine a number of reasons for this difference which don’t have to do with the value of Codeup. Maybe the average web developer is older and more experienced on the job than the average pre-Codeup student. Maybe national salaries are higher than San Antonio salaries, on average.I mean, I’m sure they are.But still. If one of your goals is to swim in a higher-paid talent pool, it might pay to learn the butterfly stroke.How much would 15 peak years of earning $61,525 more than you earn now be worth, like, right now? Again, I don’t think it’s as high as 15 times $61,525, or $922,875, because of the whole discounted cashflow of money in the future not being worth as much money today. Also, to be fair, you probably won’t earn the average national salary until you had a few years to ramp up your career.But what about discounting 15 years of an additional $61,525 per year, at a 5% rate, starting 5 years from now, using the exact same formula that we used before. Discounting those 15 years of earning the average industry salary gives me a value, today, of $500,366.44. Which, to state the obvious, is 31X the price of tuition.With those kinds of numbers I start to feel like that sales guy from Entourage: “What if I was to tell you that you’d pay $16,000 tuition to Codeup for something worth $500K today? Is that something you might be interested in?”Look, seriously, there are a lot of assumptions embedded in my statement that “you could pay $16K in tuition today for future salary jumps worth $500K, today.”Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Most important of these is the assumption that, by training as a programmer, you can earn the national average salary for programming jobs. And we all know there’s no guarantee that happens.But – and this is a big but – it’s not a crazy assumption. Because, really, it’s an assumption that the average happens.It’s an assumption that you could be paid what other people in your industry are generally paid. It’s an assumption that markets are somewhat efficient.  It’s an assumption that, if you have valuable skills, you can find employers and work situations just like other people.All of which makes me pretty confident that the financial return on a skills upgrade like Codeup can be somewhere between 12 and 31 times the upfront tuition cost.As I said before, education leads to more sparkling conversations as well as to a more fully actualized life. Of that, I have no doubt.But I appreciate my friend Girdley’s business-like approach to showing that the value of his program can be somewhere between a 12 and 31 times multiple of your investment. Just thinking like a finance guy, is that something you might be interested in?Codeup Creates Free Teen Programming ClassesCodeup Grads Released Into General PopulationCodeup Creates Crowdfunding Tuition ProgramNo Corner Offices at The New GeekdomJumping the Corporate Ship into a Sea of Startups",[],[],"[('that', 'measure')]",[],True
https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-set-to-offer-data-science-program-beginning-in-february/?share=email,Codeup Set to Offer Data Science Program Beginning in February,"San Antonio ReportWeb development trade school Codeup has received approval from the Texas Workforce Commission to train aspiring data scientists during a new 18-week course.Data science is a growing profession in which demand for trained workers is high but supply is scarce, said senior data scientist Maggie Giust, whom Codeup hired to lead the instruction for the course.“Larger companies like H-E-B, Rackspace, and USAA are growing their data scienceIn 2012, the Harvard Business Review trumpeted data scientist as the “sexiest job of the 21st century” and postings for data scientists on job search site Indeed have risen sharply over the past several years.The University of Texas at San Antonio recently announced it is set to build a new School of Data Science, which will house all information technology-related academic programs, at its downtown campus as soon as the 2021-22 academic year.Jungle Disk and Quickpath Analytics are among the local employers who have shown interest in increasing the data scientist pipeline, said Dimitri Antoniou, Codeup’s director of business development.Mike DeFelice, who leads Jungle Disk’s data science operations and is the chief technology officer for fledgling insurance startup CyberFortress, said he met with Codeup several months ago to help build the data science curriculum from an employer’s perspective.The profession itself is still very young, and there are few standards to help employers hire for it, DeFelice said. If Codeup’s first two cohorts are successful, San Antonio will have as many as 50 new data scientists to help companies derive value from the massive amounts of data they have gathered over the years, he said.“I think … 50 new data-science-focused coders that can go and work in a company is just going to prove that we need more of them,” he said. “I think it’s a wonderful thing for San Antonio.”A data scientist uses a combination of computer programming, statistical analysis, and visualizations to take large data sets and make sense of them.Antoniou said he is expecting the entry-level salary for a data scientist graduating from Codeup to be “substantially higher” than an entry-level software developer’s.Although no technical experience is required to enroll in Codeup’s web development program – its advertising campaign touts students who have gone from working as coffee baristas to becoming software developers – a background in math, computer programming, or business is preferred for applicants looking to enter the data science program.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.“I believe somebody who’s hungry enough can train up on those things to get to a point where they can start our program,” Antoniou said. “But, more commonly, we’ll probably see people transitioning from a math undergraduate degree, work as a business analyst or software developer, or someone who already has some of that expertise built into their professional background.”The course costs $22,500. Codeup said it will refund half the tuition if a graduate does not find a job within six months.The course is scheduled to begin Feb. 4 with 25 students learning in one of three new classrooms built as part of Codeup’s recent expansion within the Vogue Building downtown.

http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2015/01/16/new-web-developers-debut-at-codeups-demo-day/,New Web Developers Debut at Codeup's Demo Day - SiliconHills,"SiliconHillsTechnology news about Austin and San AntonioBy LAURA LOREKLiz Cole, John Staudt and Jason Birdwell, graduates of Codeup.For three months Josee Farmer drove daily from North Austin to San Antonio to learn how to become a web developer at Codeup.Liz Cole, John Staudt and Jason Birdwell, graduates of Codeup.“It was totally worth it,” Farmer said.She recently relocated from North Carolina to Texas and she wanted to get into the technology industry. But she didn’t have a technical background. She previously worked in the healthcare industry. When she got accepted to attend Codeup, a 12 week bootcamp that turns non-coders into proficient coders, she was thrilled. “I would not have been able to do this on my own without Codeup,” Farmer said. “It was totally worth it.”Josee Farmer, a recent graduate of CodeupLast Wednesday, Farmer was one of a group of students who graduated from the latest class of Codeup. She participated in the Codeup Demo Day and showed off work she and her teammates did on a project called Filmseedr, which lets filmmakers crowdfund money for projects.Josee Farmer, a recent graduate of CodeupThey presented their projects during a demonstration and reception at Peer 1 at the Pearl.Since Codeup launched in 2013, 72 students have learned how to become web developers. Codeup has held four Demo Days. And most of the graduates have found jobs locally, Girdley said. He founded Codeup with Jason Straughan and Chris Turner.Michael Girdley, co-founder of Codeup“About 85 percent of the people are staying locally,” he said. “People have also gone to Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Jose for jobs.”Michael Girdley, co-founder of CodeupCodeup also runs a program for veterans. It recently launched Codeyear, a gap year program, aimed at high school graduates. They spend six months to a year at Codeup learning technical skills and the program gets them an internship with a tech startup, Girdley said.Students are coming from all over the state and country to attend Codeup, Girdley said.Paul Kuzma, a recent graduate of CodeupPaul Kuzma relocated from Indianapolis, Indiana to attend the bootcamp. He was trying to teach himself web development but it wasn’t going very well and he wanted to complete the program by the time his daughter was born.Paul Kuzma, a recent graduate of CodeupKuzma, who previously worked as an elementary and junior high school teacher, said coding bootcamps don’t really exist in the Midwest except for one program in Chicago that was out of his price range.Kuzma stayed with a friend in San Antonio while participating in the Codeup bootcamp. His wife gave birth to their daughter on New Year’s Day. Kuzma had completed the program. He flew back last week to participate in the Demo Day. His team created WorldMentr.org, a matchmaking service aimed at connecting college students with mentors in their chosen profession. Kuzma said the program gave him the skills he needs to land a job as a front end and back end web developer.  He now knows PHP, MySQL, HTML5 and CSS3, JavaScript and Laravel.John Staudt, a former high school AP English teacher, needed a change and got into coding gradually over the years. He planned to teach himself to become a developer, but then he found out about Codeup and he joined the program.He eventually wants to launch his own company. His team built MyLocal.Beer as their project, a Web app that helps people find local beers.Liz Cole, who previously worked as a personal assistant, also worked on the MyLocal.Beer site. She did the front-end development.“Before Codeup, I had no coding experience,” Cole said. “I had an art degree. I was kind of floundering trying to figure out what I was going to do.”Codeup taught her the skills to become a web developer.“I love the design aspect of it and being able to mix logic with design,” Cole said.The next Codeup class in web development and software engineering kicks off Feb. 3rd, Girdley said. The class is already two-thirds full, he said. Demand continues to grow for the bootcamps, he said.“We’ll probably be oversubscribed,” he said.Name *Email *Website This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-grads-released-general-population-2/?share=email,Codeup Grads Released Into General Population,"San Antonio ReportWhat can one person achieve in three months?  How about embarking on a future in one of the fastest growing industries in the country?Codeup is an intense, 11-week web programming bootcamp that accelerates students with often zero development experience into coding powerhouses ready for the open and growing job market.  According to U.S. News and World Report, web developers earned a median salary of $62,500 in 2012, a number that is growing each year as supply continued to trail demand. With the exponentially expanding tech market hitting its stride in San Antonio, Codeup students are groomed for immediate placement in the job market.The very first Codeup class crossed the finish line Tuesday afternoon during “Demo Day” at the Briscoe Western Art Museum. Demo Day is essentially a market-oriented graduation exercise. Instead of standing in a line waiting for diplomas, Codeup classmates present personal and group projects (capstones) they have been working on during their three-month course. With luck, their future bosses are in the audience listening.Students, mentors, and business recruiters gathered for the people pitches and to congratulate Codeup grads and network with them about job opportunities.Each capstones project was presented by a three-student group, each one tasked from conceptualization to a fully-functioning web application in a deadline-driven, 10-day period.One project, Local Care Package (Leslie Tolbert, Ken Priest, and Brandon Beidel) offered a curated box full of “picks from a local” for those that are new in town and want to see what our city has to offer.Attention getting presentations like M.B. Athletes (Andres Dunn, Orlanda Villasenor, and Dylan Yoowitaya-Peralta) is a scouting tracker for military student athletes stationed in other parts of the world where recruiters often cannot make the trip.  M.B. Athletes concept gives the recruiter, coach, student, and family a way to connect through a sophisticated web design with profiles and videos tracking the athlete’s every statistic.Each project was well-conceived and properly delivered.  Serious work was put into each presentation and each group had lots to show.  It’s easy to imagine these projects, with more time and work, becoming successful startups one day.Codeup takes an often overlooked, unconventional approach to education.  For starters, students who don’t receive a job offer within six months of finishing Codeup get half of their tuition reimbursed. Tuition was about $8,000 for the inaugural class but will be adjusted to $9,850 for the next batch after Codeup Founder Michael Girdley adjusts for realized course costs. Girdley talked with me about the shift of local education, entrepreneurship and most importantly, the future of his students.“We believe an educational institution should only profit if and only if it provides results,” he said.What initially feels like a leap into darkness for 28 daring students, Codeup is confident its teachings will help students become candidates for employment in the space of 11 weeks.“The conventional education system is leaving people with tons of inescapable debt and usually no future,” Girdley said. “One applicant had a four-year degree and the best job he could find was selling timeshares at the mall. Disgusting.”Mitch Connell, one of the students enrolled in Codeup’s inagural class, is a 43-year-old former construction worker with 20 years experience. Connell  heard about CodeUp through a story on Texas Public Radio..“Right away, it clicked and I thought, that’s what I want to do,” he said.Connell  described his time at Codeup as “intense, but rewarding.  It’s like learning four different languages all at once, and none of them use the English alphabet.“On a personal level, I wanted to challenge myself and prove that I wasn’t too old to learn something completely new,” he said. “It was a risk, and I definitely had moments where I questioned myself. Now that the program is over, I can look back and feel proud of what I accomplished and learned.”Employers from more than 90 businesses were in attendance, most of which were looking to hire recruits immediately. Major employers, including H-E-B and Rackspace, were in attendance.Mary Valdez of H-E-B was asked about about the value of Codeup hosting an event to connect graduates with potential employers.“Codeup drives students who have a passion for what they really want to do and gives students the foundation to build on their skill levels when they enter the workplace,” she said.I also spoke with Brian Aleman from ManTech, an international cyber security company with an office located near the San Antonio International Airport. Until recently, Aleman recruited mainly from California because of a lack of local applicants.“It’s exciting to see local talent who is interested in coding, learning more, and working on some really cool stuff,” Aleman said. “California used to be the only place jobs like this existed, now it is right here and it’s growing.”San Antonio District 1 Councilman Diego Bernal arrived to support the class as they emerge into the San Antonio job market.  I asked Bernal about the future of technology in our expanding downtown environment:Scott Ball: With the tech push currently happening in San Antonio with businesses like Google Fiber and Rackspace setting up shop here in San Antonio, how can we lure these companies to locate in the downtown area?Diego Bernal: This is where they want to be because the employees that they naturally have don’t want to be in suburbia, they want to be where the action is, they want to be where the city is, where the culture and art is, and they want to be around each other. There is something to be said about an ecosystem of companies like the ones you just mentioned. Downtown is a natural place for that and you are finding that happening.  I think the folks at Rackspace are probably trying to figure out a way how to migrate down here if we are being honest.SB: Codeup is thriving after their first successful bootcamp.  How do you as a public figure play a role in a new local tech companies success?Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.DB: Part of my job is to make sure that people here and other places know that it exists.  The success of Codeup speaks for itself, this is sort of like the tech industry’s version of the science fair and all of the projects are blue ribbon, and it’s really amazing.  We can help with this exposure and let other folks know that endeavors like this are absolutely supported and encouraged, and welcomed by the city. We as a city government want to see more of it and we will do everything we can to help bring them here, but beyond that, since Codeup is here, our number one priority is that we fortify it.Codeup’s ideal student, Girdley said, is  “motivated and committed.”It is apparent that the entire first class embodies these two identifying qualities. Housed at the startup offices of Geekdom the path the students originally chose to take has changed during their time at Codeup.“This Codeup class entered with only a handful wanting to be entrepreneurs,” Girdley said. “Over time with us, they’ve seen they now have a power they didn’t see before.”Codeup teaches code, but it’s evident it also imbues students with a new level of confidence. A supportive staff confident the graduates will find good jobs add to that sense of positive energy, and the co-working Geekdom space incubates like-minded individuals with aspirations to elevate themselves through technology. It’s an impressive start by an impressive startup.*Featured/top image: Codeup Founder Michael Girdley and Chris Turner pose on the Codeup DeLorean during the Codeup Demo Day April 22, 2014.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-creates-crowdfunding-tuition-program-2/?share=email,Codeup Creates Crowdfunding Tuition Program,"San Antonio ReportCodeup is a for-profit educational startup in San Antonio that takes people from non-techie to full fledged hirable programmer in 12 weeks. Created by entrepreneur and startup investor Michael Girdley, the programming boot camp not only teaches students the skills employers need today through constant mentorship and hands-on training, but helps connect them to partnering employers both at graduation and afterwards.But it ain’t cheap. At $9,850 the program is worth roughly half of a nice new car. The price is by no means bad for a programming boot camp – a similar 12-week program at Austin’s MakerSquare would cost $13,880 and San Francisco’s Hack Reactor runs you $17,780 – but for some, it’s still a significant economic barrier. Full and part time jobs are almost certainly out of the question, because between all-day classes and homework, students are looking at about 60 hours of coursework per week.That’s why Codeup just launched a tuition crowdfunding portal where students can crowdfund some or all of their tuition. The simple site takes you directly to the student profile page where participating students have a video to promote themselves and a brief description of where they will go with their programming education.Users can pledge between $25 and $1,000 by credit card and also can promote their recipient student’s fundraising campaign on social media with the click of a button. Four students accepted for the coming semester already have created crowdfunding profiles, which will be up for a month, and more students may join if the model proves effective.Girdley got the idea for a crowdfunding tuition model after talking to friend and Geekdom Manager and 80/20 Foundation Executive Director Lorenzo Gomez about Kiva.org – a global microloan site.“One of the things that is really powerful about Geekdom is that I have the best conversations when I am walking to get coffee with people or talking about issues that are happening,” Gridley said. “That was one of the conversations I had with Lorenzo, so we went and pursued it.”“This is the future of tuition and paying for your school in my opinion,” Gomez said. “You can go and spend $30,000 on a degree. There’s nothing wrong with that option. But if you need to acquire a skill in a timely fashion and get working right away you can now go to a 12-week boot camp, crowdsource to get some or all of the tuition you need, and then go through and get life-altering skills taught to you in a compressed amount of time.”The crowdfounding option is great for recently accepted Codeup student Jonathan Robinson, who would have had to go into debt to take advantage of the program.“I would have had to take out some extra loans,” Robinson said. “There is an opportunity to pay for it up front but it would put me in greater debt because I am still paying off student loans. I’m using the crowdfunding to help supplement my cost.”Robinson has a degree in business marketing from Hampton University. After saving some money, he left his sales job at San Antonio medical company Medtronic to try and build a programming career with Codeup.“It’s a growing job opportunity and companies are looking for it. Here in San Antonio they are trying to become a tech area so you want to make sure you are ahead of the game and not trying to play catch-up,” Robinson said. “It’s the opportunity I’ve been waiting for and I’m just ready to get started with it.”Codeup launched its first programming boot camp on Feb. 3 of this year. The inaugural class is now in the final three weeks and will graduate April 22. This first class, as a kind of experiment, was originally scheduled for 8 weeks and cost $8,000, but adjustments to lesson, practice length and material/instructor costs had to be made.Their graduation ceremony at The Briscoe Western Art Museum will be a kind of “reverse job fair,” where employers will attend and approach any candidates they might like to hire.The second boot camp, which will benefit from the crowdfunding campaign, will begin on May 6 and has 15 of 30 seats available. Getting accepted is a competitive process as Girdley has already received 70 student applications and expects to receive quite a few more before filling the class.Codeup boot camps mainly focus on web development and cover Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript. Camps also features visits from tech industry professionals who speak on a variety of entrepreneurial topics and help students network. The course curriculum was created as a direct response to the needs of the local tech community and Codeup has hiring partnerships with 55 startups and larger tech companies who have agreed to consider hiring Codeup graduates. In fact, Girdley is so confident that Codeup will find students employment that he offers a guarantee: Students not offered a job within six months of completing the course will get half their tuition back.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.While the true results of the first Codeup class, and the job opportunities that result, will not be known until after the April 22 graduation, Girdley is not shy about his dislike of traditional higher education system, and he wants to turn the whole system on its head to better educate tech professionals.“If you look at everything we are doing, it’s exactly the opposite of how classical education is done,” Girdley said. “You look at a college or a job training program and the first thing they try to do is saddle people with a whole bunch of debt. We don’t want to do that. If you look at their instructors, they hang out with you for an hour or two hours a couple days a week. Our instructors are with you for over 700 hours — all day every day as a group with the students. College is usually one professor and 30 students. We have seven instructors in a class of 28 … and the cool thing is, you come talk to our students and they’ll tell you it’s totally working.”Codeup is still accepting applications for both the May 6 and August 5 boot camps.

https://sanantonioreport.org/codeup-creates-free-teen-programming-classes/?share=email,Codeup Creates Free Teen Programming Classes,"San Antonio Report“Give a man a computer program and he’ll eat for a day. Teach the man computer programming and he’ll eat for a lifetime and start his own tech company.” I think that’s how the saying goes.Teaching people to code is the sole mission of Geekdom startup Codeup, which has created a crash course in computer programming to take hard-working individuals from non-techie to hirable programmer in only 12 weeks.(Read More: Codeup Grads Released Into General Population)While that program is for paying adults, Codeup is now launching a free weekend program to teach coding to teens in high school.The program is called Codeup Teens and will provide  free, two-hour programming classes on the last Saturday of every month at Geekdom of San Antonio on the 10th floor of the Weston Centre. Each session will be held from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. and will enroll about 25 students. The first class begins June 28. Students can RSVP at the Codeup Teens webpage, filling seats on a first-come-first-serve basis.“The goal is to raise overall computer literacy, and hopefully more kids will grow up and want to be in good programming jobs, rather than have lower aspirations for less demanding jobs,” Codeup founder Michael Girdley said.Girdley decided to create Codeup Teens after seeing the huge turnout of San Antonio teens for the Schools Out Hackathon, or SoHacks, which was held last weekend at Rackspace Hosting. The event drew a huge crowd of San Antonio teens, many of whom were interested in programming despite their lack of access to a personal computer, or laptop. Because of this, many teens waited in long lines at the event to borrow one of the available laptops so they could participate and start learning to program.“We just see that there is a great opportunity for us to give back to the community – to expose more people to something that could really change their life rather than doing menial labor or what they might have otherwise considered doing,” Girdley said. “It (SoHacks) opened our eyes up to the number of kids in San Antonio, especially teens, that don’t have exposure to this stuff either through school or at home and we want to help with that.”Codeup Teens is open to any teen either in high school or entering high school this fall, and the skills taught at each weekend session will depend on each student’s previous knowledge of programming. Novices will be introduced to MIT’s Scratch, an online drag-and-drop program that teaches programming fundamentals while teens who have already had some programming experience can try learning JavaScript. Laptops for the program will be provided by San Antonio non-profit VentureLab and each class will be taught by former and current Codeup students and Codeup staff volunteers. If the first few events are successful and have good turnout, Girdley may widen the scope of the program.“Entrepreneurship is all about experimentation, so social entrepreneurship is the same thing. We’re starting with this, and then we’ll see what magic happens,” Girdley said.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.Codeup’s original for-profit program is a 12-week web programming bootcamp that covers Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript; and also feature visits from tech industry professionals who speak on entrepreneurship and other topics. The startup has already graduated its first boot camp and is in the last six weeks of its second camp.According to Girdley, 23 of the 27 students who entered the inaugural class have already found employment as a programmer – which is good, because Codeup offers an employment guarantee for graduates who can’t find a job after six months, entitling them to half of their tuition back. The next available bootcamp starts Aug. 5 and is still accepting applications. Tuition is currently listed as $9,875.*Featured/top image: Codeup Demo Day at The Briscoe Western Art Museum April 22, 2014.

https://sanantonioreport.org/women-take-on-san-antonio-tech-leadership-roles-at-rackspace-codeup/?share=email,"Women Take On Leadership Roles at Rackspace, Codeup","San Antonio ReportIt’s been a good week for women in technology.Two San Antonio-based companies, Rackspace and Codeup, announced that top leadership positions were filled by female veterans of the tech industry.Carla Piñeyro Sublett, who was previously Rackspace’s CMO of the Americas region and the executive director of marketing for Dell’s Latin America region, has been promoted to senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Rackspace.Kay Jones, who worked at Rackspace for 11 years, most recently as senior manager of workforce planning and organizational development, is the new CEO of Codeup, a coding bootcamp.Both women are proud to be leaders in their companies, and both remain steadfast in their desire to advance women’s roles in the tech industry and beyond.During her 16 years at Dell, Carla Piñeyro Sublett saw the small company morph into a worldwide computer supplier. Her transition from Dell to Rackspace, she said, had the potential to be difficult, but her experience as director of marketing for Latin America at Dell prepared her well. She’ll be overseeing marketing functions for the hosting company worldwide.“Working in an emerging market was like working in a mid-size business at times,” Piñeyro Sublett told the Rivard Report. “The transition to Rackspace was like working at Dell in the beginning.”Piñeyro Sublett sees her new position as a way to improve Rackspace in key regions like Latin America, where it can grow to dominate the cloud-based competition.“There are tons of opportunities for Rackspace. We have a global footprint, so I think that having a global perspective is super important to growth,” she said.With Piñeyro Sublett’s promotion, the Rackspace leadership team includes 11 women, or about 14% of total leadership roles, Christina Weaver, a Rackspace spokeswoman, confirmed in an email. The company’s overall female employment is 23%.Piñeyro Sublett, who sits on The Texas Conference for Women board, sees mentoring as the the biggest responsibility females leaders have to younger generations of women.“I’m one of several really strong female leaders at Rackspace. They are strong role models in the community and internally (at Rackspace),” Piñeyro Sublett said. “This position comes with the responsibility of being a role model. We have to lift up other women within our communities.”After just over a decade at Rackspace as senior manager of workforce planning, Kay Jones was looking for a new way to participate in the San Antonio tech scene. Without realizing it at the time, she was also looking for a way to work downtown.“I probably hadn’t really experienced downtown San Antonio in eight years. In coming back now, there’s such a dramatic difference in just the vibe, and the atmosphere,” Jones said. “When I had the opportunity to meet with Codeup, it was just a beautiful fit between one thing I love, which is education and advancing adult learners, and the other thing I love, which is urban development. That spark between the two was just such a great fit that I couldn’t bring myself to turn away from it.”But Jones knows that the downtown tech scene grew from the hard work of city leaders and the tech community, and it’s what made her stay San Antonio instead of moving to Austin.“It’s been amazing to see this group of leaders really step up and say, ‘We want to see this city change for the better without losing its identity,’” she said.Jones said that her early years at Rackspace gave her a strong sense of her direct impact on the lives of employees, but as the company grew, she lost a little bit of that impact.“I had 2,500 people under my organizational purview (at Rackspace), and here (at Codeup) I feel like maybe I can actually get my hands into the inner workings of the startup,” Jones said. Codeup, founded in 2014, is a much smaller company. “I think so much of my desire was to take this huge body of knowledge that I was able to gather from Rackspace … and to translate it into a company that has a similar mission to change lives and to help people.”Michael Girdley, current board member and former CEO of Codeup, said that the search for the new CEO began with a focus on diversity.“As we went on the hunt to find the right person, we wanted to continue to diversify tech, so my first choice was a female CEO,” Girdley said. “For us, if we’re going to talk so much about (diversity), then we’re going to do it.”Girdley said that his decision to find a new CEO was based in a realization that as Codeup has grown, the company needed a CEO who can develop employee talent.“The company is growing, and as more students are going through (Codeup) and more processes are being put in place, the company needs different people at different stages,” Girdley said. “There are people like Kay who are going to put those processes in place and are going to do a better job of that than I could.”Female students currently make up 26% of students at Codeup, but Jones is not satisfied with that number. Despite her pride in the student diversity at Codeup, she hopes that her presence at the helm of will continue to have a positive impact.“I believe that we will actually be able to get little bit more ‘oomph’ out of our population,” Jones said with a laugh. “I anticipate that we’re going to see a little bit of an upswing in the number of female participants.”Marina Gavito is the executive director of Tech Bloc, a tech industry advocacy organization, and a past colleague of Jones. She said Jones is a “people leader,” a trait that is difficult to find in the tech industry.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.“She is extremely passionate about helping San Antonio build the tech ecosystem,” Gavito said. “Codeup is already going down a good path in the coding bootcamp space. Knowing Kay and her abilities, she’s going to hit the ground running and take them to next level.”Gavito said that Jones, as a female CEO in tech — something that is still unusual — has people rooting for her.“I love that she’s in this role. She is a strong leader regardless of (being) male or female. I’m personally happy because here we see a woman leader in tech doing something,” Gavito said. “I’m excited to watch what she’s going to do next.”For Jones though, her stake in this position is a little more personal.“I can’t say that there isn’t a part of me that just really feels compelled to ensure my success and the success of women in general. I have a 13-year-old daughter and I need her to know that she can do absolutely anything she desires to do,” Jones said.As a woman in a leadership role in tech, Jones said she carries the burden of being invested in both her family and her work life. Despite its many challenges, she asserts that women can do it, and they can do it extremely well.“You can fulfill both sides of your life in a really powerful way if you have the willingness to go a little outside of your comfort zone and try something new and invest yourself deeply in what you’re doing,” she said.*Top Image: Codeup CEO Kay Jones.

https://sanantonioreport.org/commentary-codeups-new-institute-aims-to-reinvent-college/?share=email,Commentary: Codeup's New Institute Aims to Reinvent College,"San Antonio ReportWe live in a global, technology-driven economy and workforce where, in the words of Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape and famous investor, “software is eating the world.”Don’t believe me? Below is a sample of the world’s largest and fastest growing companies by category:Bookseller – AmazonNetflixiTunes, Spotify, and PandoraGoogle and GrouponSkypeLinkedInWhat do all of these businesses have in common? They are software companies. And the list doesn’t stop with these more obvious examples. Many companies in traditional industries, such as banking and insurance, also see themselves as evolving technology companies.However, in the midst of this age of technological progress, I regularly hear from executives of startups and corporations that we, as a society, are not creating high-skill technology talent with the necessary job-ready abilities at a scale to drive productivity and innovation.And I’m concerned that this problem likely will not be solved in the current, traditional education environment.The ability for someone to pursue higher education in any field is becoming a challenge, particularly because of financial barriers. Rising costs of college tuition either prevent college attendance entirely or lead to significant student loan debt.How are we going to solve these challenges?I’ve recently joined the team at Codeup, a computer programming school for mid-career changers and veterans in downtown San Antonio, as vice president of education to tackle these challenges. Our answer to the pressing higher education challenges is Codeup Institute.Through Insitute, we aim to revolutionize higher education access, success, and career readiness in computer science.Codeup Institute is a two-year, automated software engineering apprenticeship powered by a self-directed, peer-to-peer learning model for recent high school graduates. Codeup Institute’s mission is straightforward: graduate talented software engineers and technologists with the knowledge, experience, and skills to excel in the Digital Age.Its education model, “Empowered Education,” fuses three fundamental learning concepts: a challenge-based curriculum, peer-to-peer learning, and a student-driven education. Adapted from the internationally renowned Ecole 42 in Paris, France, Codeup Institute eliminates the high costs associated with instructors and student-purchased textbooks while adding the value that accrues from a rigorous, peer-to-peer learning environment.Codeup Institute students spend two years in-person at our downtown campus intensely focused on learning top-notch programming skills. Through an approach that blends a comprehensive computer science foundation with applied, industry-related skills (mobile and web development), Codeup Institute will bridge the gap between higher education and industry needs.From the first day of class, students will be assigned programming challenges of escalating difficulty and will solve them using open-source online resources, their fellow students, and Codeup Institute’s knowledgeable mentors. While nearly everything a student needs to learn about programming can be found on the Internet, at no cost, motivation is the single greatest barrier to pushing through the content and acquiring the necessary skills and theoretical foundation needed in technology careers. As such, the concept of peer-facilitated learning is fundamental at Insitute.The atmosphere of authentic teamwork and collaboration develops essential soft skills, such as grit and creative problem-solving acumen, which contribute to professional success. As a support network, 23 programmers (to date) from companies across San Antonio have signed on to invest their time and passion for coding as mentors for Institute.Tuition is $10,000 a year ($1,250 a year for students from a household income of less than $40,000); 100% financing is available for all students who qualify. As a first-generation college graduate with student loans, I feel that financial accessibility for those historically unable to enter/complete college is an incredibly impactful component of Codeup Institute. I wholeheartedly believe in Codeup Institute’s value to establish higher education access and success as the norm, not the exception, and it starts by tackling the cost of higher education.I’m working with Jason Straughan, Chris Turner and Michael Girdley, the three co-founders of Codeup computer programming bootcamp. Codeup results are impressive: 96% of graduates are employed within six months. The average graduate is making $45,000 right out of the program, on a trajectory to earn the nationwide mean for a web developer of $90,000. On average, graduates increase their earnings by $13,000 as a result of the program.Codeup Institute will not only increase social and economic mobility of San Antonio’s most valuable resource – its people – but be an economic engine for the city by producing employable software engineers.Readers like you keep our public service journalism free.Our nonprofit newsroom publishes trusted reporting that enables residents to build a better city. But we can't do this work alone.According to the University of California, Berkeley economist Enrico Moretti in “The New Geography of Jobs,” each high-skill technology job creates five other jobs outside the technology industry. Also, according to “The Hidden STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) Economy” by the Brookings Institution, “More STEM-oriented metropolitan economies perform strongly on a wide variety of economic indicators, from innovation to employment. Job growth, employment rates, patenting, wages, and exports are all higher in more STEM-based economies.”If you’re an individual, government, or business looking for a meaningful, strong return on investment, look no further than the field of computer science.What would cause Google to open an office – not in Austin, New York, or Chicago – but in San Antonio?

https://codeup.com/smu-trilogy-or-codeup/,smu trilogy or codeup - Codeup,"Thinking about attending a coding bootcamp? Find the best fit for your goalsThere’s no right answer for everyone, but here are some important criteria to consider:Codeup was founded in San Antonio in 2013 by 3 co-founders to help people change careers. Today, those 3 co-founders remain our only owners. We are built in Texas and carry no debt or venture capital investment. Moreover, we’re approved by the Department of Veteran Affairs to accept the GI Bill (which is NOT a simple process to work through). SMU’s coding bootcamp is actually run by a large education company called Trilogy, which in turn is owned by a company called 2U. You might think you’re buying the SMU brand, but your education is actually the last leg of a baton race of investment. Because they work under the umbrella of a university, this bootcamp is not required to publish outcomes, approve instructors, or abide by any of the regulations set up by the Texas Workforce Commission for career schools.Codeup will help you land a job or give you back 100% of your tuition. We put our money on the line with our promise to launch your career. Our grads leverage a 99% employment rate, an average time of 2.1 weeks to hire, and partners like Oracle, USAA, Cognizant, and Accenture. All of that is backed up by the fact that we publish our outcomes through the Texas Workforce Commission and Council for Integrity in Results and Reporting. SMU does not publish outcomes, so there is no available data on employment rate, time to hire, starting salary, job titles, or anything else. Programming is like a trade – practice is the most important thing. You learn through an instructor-led, hands on curriculum of over 670 hours. SMU’s coding bootcamp is only 210 hours spread part time over 12 weeks. Even though their program is 69% shorter, they also teach a curriculum that covers more languages and technologies than we do. At Codeup, we teach an enterprise stack to suit the hiring needs of partners like Oracle, USAA, and Cognizant.

As a career accelerator, both begin with our state regulators, the Texas Workforce Commission, through which we are licensed as a Texas Career School. To ensure we are delivering on our promises, we submit annual outcomes reports that summarize program completion and post-graduation employment rates for the period of September through August. These are reviewed and published through the state on an annual basis for the previous year.Unfortunately, every state has different regulatory procedures, which means bootcamps all over the country report, are reviewed, and publish differently. Ultimately, this impacts students negatively by reducing transparency, clarity, and accessibility of those numbers. Some bootcamps report employment rates for subsets of their graduates, while others publish for only specific time periods. To bridge this gap, Codeup has teamed up with Ascent Funding and the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting to improve transparency in results reporting so students can make informed decisions. As a voluntary measure to improve transparency, Codeup submits two reports, conducts an external audit, and publishes through CIRR twice each year.If you have more questions about outcomes reporting, reach out to us at info@codeup.com!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

They want to see a consistent history of commits as well as substantive code. That said, getting to the point where you are discussing your commit history with a hiring manager is not easy. GitJob is the GitHub of the job search: a one-stop shop for job openings and other helpful resources. Below you will find spreadsheets of both Development and Data Science jobs, as well as a curriculum-neutral table of resources to assist in your job search.When you apply to a job, apply through the company website if possible. This will get your name to the top of their list. When jobs are sourced for the Bulletin, the company-specific link will be pulled where possible. If not, simply Google the company name and job title, or “[company name] careers page” / “[company name] jobs”. A few minutes of extra searching can get you the job of a lifetime.Remember, if you don’t submit the jobs you apply for through the Job Form, they will not be counted in the weekly competition for $15 in Udemy credit… Plus, the Placement team is actively reaching out to every company on these lists to improve your odds of winning that job!As you prepare for interviews, please make sure to let your MEP know about every one! That way, we can help you maximize your chances of winning. Following each interview, the final step is to fill out the Post-Interview Form.“When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”Spock; science officer for the USS EnterpriseSubmit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.
