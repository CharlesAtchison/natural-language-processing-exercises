https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-speech-pathology-to-business-intelligence/,True,"Oct 18, 2021 | Alumni StoriesBy: Alicia GonzalezBefore Codeup, I was a home health Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant. I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.Then one day as I was on my way to a patient’s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said “drive to a job you love” and I took it as a sign. I thought, “I want to drive to a job I love!” I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.At first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn’t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.It was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, “okay this IS what I wanted to be doing.” I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.Overall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn’t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.Now after graduating from Codeup, I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I’ve been here almost three months now and I’m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I’m doing and how far I’ve come since working here. I didn’t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don’t teach. It’s been really good.I’m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I’m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I’m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I’m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn’t change a thing.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

You could become a web developer or data scientist or study UI/UX and graphic design. Or for those of you reading right now, you might be looking at entering a career in networking, cybersecurity, or cloud administration. Which might lead you to ask: what’s the difference, and which program is right for me?Both these programs are 13-weeks long. While they have different names, they share a lot of similar content as entry-level IT accelerators. Of the seven technical modules, four of them are shared. Both cover:Networking, Linux, Windows, and AWS are a LOT of content for new IT employees. Outside of this content, the programs split into their areas of focus:Now that you understand where the programs are similar and where they differ, which one is right for you? Here are some questions to consider:If you don’t have any work or education in IT, the Systems Engineering program is the one for you. It is designed to be the 0-1 step in your IT career to get you started! If you do have work experience or education in IT, then you might be interested in Cyber Cloud. Why is that?Our programs focus on CompTIA certifications, which is a major industry provider in technical training. The typical track through their IT certifications is to start with their A+, then complete their Network +, and then progress to their Security +. That means if you don’t have your Network + (or relevant experience), it can be really hard to catch up. Still not sure which is right for you?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/why-you-need-the-best-coding-bootcamp-instructors/,True,"May 21, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsOne of the many reasons students love Codeup is our focus on people. With live interaction every day, the best coding bootcamp instructors empower each student to change their life. Many try learning a new skill with free modules or self-paced courses to save money, but when you lack that human guidance, what happens when you don’t know what to learn next? What happens when you need more explaining or can’t figure out what you did wrong? What if you lose motivation and start to give up? Live, expert, personalized instruction is what will get you through the hard times and to a new career.If you’re serious about changing careers, you gotta have a good instructor. It needs to be a live, responsive instructor with industry experience, that knows how to teach you what you need to know. You’ll need a curriculum that will actually get you your desired job, based on hands-on practice and skill-building rather than theory. It should cover the entire data science pipeline or app development process to prepare you for the work you will do in-field. The classroom size must be small enough so that you get the individualized attention you deserve. Instructors need to be as invested as you are in setting you up for a successful career and motivate you if you start to give up.Luckily, you can find the best of the best instructors at Codeup. They range in industry experience from entry-level to senior-level. However, even those that are more entry-level may be senior-level educators or senior-level in a particular topic of the curriculum. With a diverse staff of instructors that all shine in different areas of expertise, you’ll have a built-out team that can provide the most value and mentorship to you. Better a full team of experts than a jack of all trades but master of none.Not only will you have expert instructors, but they also really care about you. In college, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. At other bootcamps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live, interactive lecture and lab. However, Codeup instructors are like personal mentors. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you an answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change. Feel ready to make a career change with a team of mentors to help guide you through it? Your mentor instructors will make sure you understand everything, are there when you reach a roadblock, and will keep you accountable to your learning with project-based assignments on a curriculum inspired by employers.

Designed to help you launch your career in tech, these programs take you from 0 experience to IT hero with certifications and hands-on experience in just weeks. But if you’re new to tech, you might be wondering…what is Systems Engineering?In IT terms, a Systems Engineer (Sysadmin or Sysad for short) is responsible for the configuration, upkeep, and operation of computer systems. They manage things like security, storage, automation, troubleshooting, and a whole lot more. For example, some of the day to day tasks include things like:You might be thinking, “Woah, that looks like a lot!” and that’s because it is! A Systems Engineer is a critical piece of IT infrastructure. And in today’s digital age, all companies are IT companies, which means Sysadmins are critical everywhere. You can think of a Sysad as a jack-of-all-trades of what we typically think of as IT. But don’t forget how the old saying actually ends: “A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of none.” So, what are the skills a Sysadmin uses?Now you know what a Sysadmin does and what skills they use. But why become a Sysadmin? The world is increasingly dependent on computer systems and their underlying technologies. Configuring computer software, designing innovative solutions for specific problems, and basic troubleshooting skills are more and more in demand each year.  Without systems engineers, the technical world would stop innovating and become stagnant.Interested in learning more?

But Downtown San Antonio is where we were born and raised, and where we’ve planted our flag for our headquarters. While other Texas cities are becoming known for tech, San Antonio never has been. This is the city where we can make the biggest impact on the local tech scene. We’re supplying companies with the in-demand tech talent that has been missing locally while changing lives by launching San Antonians into these tech careers. The SA Tech District is growing downtown and the historic Vogue building is in the heart of it all! We’ve been part of that action for 7 years and in the Vogue Building for 6 of them. Changing careers is a lot of work, both on our staff and students. We want to have fun while doing it! We need an upbeat atmosphere where we can stay plugged into San Antonio and engaged in the tech scene. Steps away from the Majestic Theater, the Riverwalk, and our old home at Geekdom, our students and staff have a location to be excited about. During the pandemic, our staff doubled in size and we’ve outgrown our two floors. As we invite our staff back to working in-office, they need to be able to fit. By expanding into the second floor, our staff will have breathing room and ample space for social distancing. Our classrooms will stay on the 6th floor, where students get the best views of downtown. If you want to get plugged into the San Antonio tech scene, you’ve got options with Codeup! Launch a career in tech as a web developer, data scientist, system administrator, or cyber cloud specialist. Work in the office with us by joining our staff. Or, hire our grads.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-went-from-codeup-to-business-owner/,True,"Apr 30, 2021 | Alumni StoriesOut of college, I was a bit of a mess. That’s what I would have told you, anyway. On the surface, I was put together. I graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 in Molecular Biology, had professor recommendations under my belt, and a clear goal to apply for a PhD program in Clinical Psychology.But as I sat in the dry Colorado sunshine on graduation day, this thought popped into my head: “I never have to go to school EVER again…” As soon as I crossed the finish line, it nauseated me to think about going back to school right away. But I felt lost. If I wasn’t going to graduate school, I didn’t have a plan anymore. What the hell was I supposed to do? Being naive and idealistic, I considered applying to the Peace Corps. My brother-in-law (bless his heart) sat me down and explained that the beginning of my career was critical. He also mentioned that it takes about a year to save up for a year of not working; otherwise, I’d have to keep depending on my parents who had already supported me through college. Being bratty and unaware of how the world works, I rolled my eyes at his perfectly logical explanations, convinced he was obsessed with making money. I sat on my high horse, lauding myself for being willing to make a sacrifice when I literally had nothing to my name. In reality, I felt lost. I didn’t recognize it at the time, but going to the Peace Corps was an excuse to run away from uncertainty. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life, and I also had these lofty dreams of maybe starting my own business one day or being a part of a movement that mattered. Sensing these hopes in me, my brother-in-law mentioned he had seen billboards around town for a coding bootcamp named Codeup. If I didn’t know what I wanted to “do”, then maybe I could build my skillset instead. My interest was piqued. Coding seemed cool. I pictured savvy devs in cute plaid shirts and man buns, and being able to live the #vanlife and become a digital nomad. (are you noticing my habit of being idealistic yet?). Buoyed by this vision, I jumped all-in. I told myself I’d go to every happy hour, mixer, network like crazy, and bond with every single one of my classmates. It worked. I landed a job in software development at a cloud security company in Dallas. After spending a year in the Engineering department of my company, I had finally come to face the reality that I wasn’t very good at coding. More importantly, I was pretty apathetic about mastering it. If I continued down my career path as a developer, I’d have to keep learning and keeping up with the latest trends in development, and nothing in me felt excited about that. I was given an opportunity to join the Marketing department as a Digital Marketing Manager. At first, I felt guilty for even considering it. Did my parents spend their hard-earned money putting me through Codeup, only for me to give it all up because I was bored? It seemed like a sin straight out of the immigrant rulebook. My dream to love what I do was “selfish” and having a sense of purpose was a “luxury”. Eventually though, I braced myself and took the leap.It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I finally felt like I was “with my people”, a collection of brainy empaths with crazy ideas. I learned so much about marketing in general, which allowed me to start up my side business as a coach. I launched my first group coaching course in 2020, and I’m writing a book to release at the start of 2022. I’m living my dream every day, learning and growing with exciting things at every turn. I’ve connected with other coaches, and built a supportive web of connections across the globe. I can’t believe how far I’ve come. But I couldn’t have done it without first building my skills. In a world that penalizes people for not fitting into a neat career category, it can sometimes get confusing for people who have lots of interests. But I realized I didn’t get here by trying to become a business owner or learn about marketing. I was just, A, open to the opportunity, and B, perfectly positioned to do so. Going through Codeup was a huge incentive for the Marketing manager to hire me, despite the fact I had ZERO marketing experience. They figured, hey, if she can learn full-stack in four months, she can definitely learn the lay of the land in marketing. My exposure to marketing gave me the necessary courage and skills to start getting my content out there. I was writing blogs, publishing podcasts, and releasing YouTube videos.With a clear mission and vision in mind, everything fell into place. It’s not that I suddenly have everything figured out; instead, I’ve gotten used to the uncertainty. I no longer worry about what my career is going to be. I know it’s not going to be “one thing”. I won’t be a coder, a writer, or a coach. I’ll be a coder-writer-coach-podcaster-marketer-salesperson-youtuber-novelist. Why choose, when I know I can make money from my unique mix of skills? Society often suggests we have to choose. But I refuse to believe that anymore. If you’re reading this and you’re uncertain about where you’re headed, it’s okay not to have all the answers. Take things day by day. Build your skillset. Follow what you love. Aim for mastery. And don’t rule out the 9-to-5 doing something you may not love. Your job doesn’t have to be your passion. A steady paycheck does wonders for anxiety and allows you to be creative and innovate in your side-hustles. Practice gratitude. Realize that, yes, things could be worse, but they can also be better. Be patient with learning to wobble on the thin line stretched between “This is enough” and “I wonder what would happen if…”Go down the rabbit holes. Be curious. And realize that life is about embracing the possibilities.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/coding-is-for-women/,True,"Apr 27, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsIn a world where 91.5% of developers are male, it’s important to remember that coding is for women, too. Our first Coding is for Women event was a space for women interested in coding to come together (virtually) and learn from each other. Women tuned in from New York, Washington, New Mexico, and of course, our home base of Texas.  The panelists for this event were two members of our instructional staff with experience working in the tech industry. Here’s what they had to say about the barriers, opportunities, and overall experience getting into and working in tech! Madeleine: I graduated from Codeup’s first Data Science cohort, worked as a Data Scientist for about 2 years, and now I’m back as a Data Science instructor! I love this institution [Codeup] and can’t stay away from it.Jasmine: I graduated from Codeup’s Web Development program last June. Now, I’m working at Codeup as a Graduate Fellow, and have a part-time job as a React Native developer. Madeleine: I was a Starbucks barista and supervisor for 11 years. I went to college on and off, changed my major about 8 times, and had a two-year gap period. It was a long process by I ended up getting a Mathematics degree. I couldn’t find a way to utilize it, so that’s when I started looking into bootcamps. As soon as I graduated from Codeup, I immediately began working at Booz Allen Hamilton for a couple years.Jasmine: I was a Pharmacy Technician for about 7 years. I started as a cashier and worked my way up. I reached a point where there was no where else I could go. The next step would’ve been Pharmacist which I didn’t want to do, so I decided to pursue tech instead. Jasmine: As a pharm tech, I realized I was more interested in the software we were using than the medicine, and didn’t want to deal with the general public. I became curious about why the little Java coffee cup was popping up on my screen every day and started getting interested in the behind-the-scenes of the platform we were using. I knew that I could do it because there are a lot of transferable skills between the two careers.Madeleine: I got some experience programming in college, but it sat in the background and didn’t mesh well with my degree. After college, I realized I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my degree so I started working aimlessly, not knowing what to do. As much as I sincerely loved the service industry, it’s almost impossible to make a sustainable living. I wanted to start utilizing my skills more. I heard about data science but didn’t know what it meant. I looked into it more right as Codeup was opening their Data Science program. It was the perfect fit to make use of  my math, programming, and natural creative storytelling skills. Jasmine: I graduated Codeup after the pandemic struck, and the job search started to feel really isolating. I found this support group of women who would meet up every week, talk about the job search, what leads we had, troubles we were having, and made connections that led to the job I have now. So, it’s really important to find community and find support during the hard times. The women in tech groups are strong support communities and support systems!Madeleine: It was an old friend from high school, actually. After college, when I wasn’t really doing anything, we had reconnected. He had just signed up for a bootcamp, which was actually formerly Rackspace Cloud Academy, which is now Codeup Cloud Academy. He helped me understand how bootcamps can fill in the gaps of traditional academia, which tends to fail at helping people find satisfying careers. Then once I was in Codeup, I got so much guidance from the instructors and career advisors that I am very, very grateful for. Madeleine: It was extremely daunting. I was shoved into this tech world after working in coffee shops my whole life. Booz Allen is a firm full of extremely talented people. I taught myself cybersecurity on my own. The other data scientists before me were a Doctor of Computer Science and an Astrophysicist. So, I was sitting here with my Bachelor’s degree and a bootcamp certificate thinking “okay, I hope I got this.” It turned out Codeup prepared way more than I anticipated in that context, where I was able to use my tools from Codeup to identify flaws in the methodologies that were being used. I was able to improve it on a pretty quick turnaround. I was really able to secure my footing and get a good reputation in the field before I even felt confident in what I was doing. The imposter syndrome may never really goes away but it was great to see that I can use the tools that I’ve learned even though I’m doubting myself. Jasmine: In my current role, I’m using a technology that we didn’t learn at Codeup, but Codeup taught me how to learn so I’m learning! I feel the imposter syndrome almost every day.  I definitely felt like “What am I doing here? I have no idea what I’m doing.” Some advice I was given, and has helped me a lot, is keeping track of accomplishments you’ve done on the job. It’s great to look back on and see how much you can do and have done. Jasmine: Learn how to learn. That’s how you’re going to get ahead, and that’s something I really learned at Codeup. We couldn’t learn everything, but when you learn how to learn, you can learn anything on your own.Madeleine:  You can’t learn everything! Don’t overburden yourself with what you should or could know. Keep studying what you enjoy naturally, persist, keep practicing. It may be hard to find a job but keep practicing. Don’t undervalue networking. Madeleine: You will have technical interviews. What gets in the way for interviewers is a perceived lack of confidence. If you can’t sell yourself in that way, everything else as far as technical knowledge comes to a halt. Keep track of everything you can do as far as technical skills. Be able to fill dead air and answer questions even if you don’t know the answer. If you get to a question you don’t know, try to probe the interview to get to a mutual point that you do know. Try to slice through ambiguity, and have general conversational skills. Even if you can’t answer it directly, you can get to a point where you can elaborate on something you’re interested in tangentially, or connect with the interviewer in a different way. It could show off some other suspect of your talent, or at the very least, show confidence.Jasmine: At the end of the day, companies want to hire someone that will make a contribution. One way to show that is by doing your research on the interviewer and the company. Who are the higher-ups, who has been hired recently? Show that you are interested in them. Jasmine: Keep a spreadsheet of every single job you’ve applied to, what resume you sent them, and where you found them. Look for communities that you identify with and network with them. I am in a group for Latinx people in tech. When I’m being really targeted with looking for positions within my community, I get a better response.Madeleine: Get involved in communities! Geekdom is a great place. I am involved in the Queer community in San Antonio. You might find yourself networking in places you didn’t initially expect, but get involved, and try to be as engaged as possible. Be yourself and show your personality if you want people to remember you. Women might be expected to be more demure, or submissive in the way they present themselves. But there’s a balance between not being perceived as aggressive, and still showing that you are confident in your skills or your personality.  Jasmine: Go to a bootcamp! I was pretty self-motivated but I still wanted more of a push, more of a community, and structure. Codeup is a great way to learn how to code, but it’s not like riding a bike! You will forget how to code if you don’t code. Stay on it so you don’t fall off.Madeleine: I’m a big fan of Codecademy if you’re just trying to get your feet wet and see if you like it. For data science, Data Camp is a great resource as well. Codecadamy can also help with Codeup’s Python pre-work and challenges during the admissions process. Jasmine: In my experience, employers expect that as a Junior Developer, you’re still learning and you are going to have to learn some things on the job. They don’t expect you to know everything, but they do expect you to be willing to learn and ready to hop in. In my position, I’m learning a new programming language on the job. At Codeup, you’ll learn how to learn a language quickly, and you can take that with you for when you get hired.Madeleine: When I was at my previous company, I had to learn Deep Learning and Cybersecurity very quickly. They helped me out with getting certifications and offering stipends for learning resources. But conversely, when I wanted to grow personally in my data science skills, that was all self-taught and on my own time and from my network. Huge “thank you” to Madeleine and Jasmine for joining us as panelists for this event! They’ve offered a wide wealth of resources and experiences to grow and learn from. To recap major points, learn how to learn, keep practicing, become confident in your skills, and be yourself when you network. There are plenty of female coders out there, and plenty of communities to join to meet like-minded women. Here in Texas, Women Who Code has communities in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. In San Antonio, check out Geekdom (a coworking space for all) and this Meetup community for women developers.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-candidate-for-accreditation/,True,"Jun 30, 2021 | Codeup NewsDid you know that even though we’re an independent school, we have multiple regulating bodies that verify our processes and results? For starters, we’re licensed and regulated by the Texas Workforce Commission. We’re also approved by the SAA Texas Veterans Commission to accept VA Benefits, and audited by the Council for Integrity in Results Reporting. This already gives us a premier status and a trusted brand name. But there’s one missing piece that would take us to the next level: an accrediting body. Now, we’re well on our way there! We are proud to announce that, effective May 2021,  Codeup is a Candidate for Accreditation by The Middle States Association Commission on Secondary Schools (MSA-CSS), which is located at 3624 Market Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (Phone: 267-284-5000).Accrediting bodies provide guidance and best practices for institutions like Codeup, and verify the quality of our education. The MSA-CSS in particular is recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education. Getting accredited by them would allow us to establish eligibility to participate in federal Title IV student loan programs for adult students. This could be huge for our applicants, as it would significantly expand access to financial aid and allow even more people to change their lives by launching a tech career at Codeup. We would also be the first and only career accelerator with MSA-CSS accreditation in Texas. One article even states that coding bootcamps, in general, are not accredited.Currently, we are a candidate for accreditation, and not yet accredited. (Establishing candidacy is in itself a big feat, and a little bird told us our application was in the top 1% over at least the last 15 years!) Now that we’re candidates, we are actively working with the MSA-CSS to meet or exceed the requirements for accreditation. This process usually takes 18-24 months. Once approved, it would be an additional 12-18 months for Title IV acceptance, which is what would enable students to receive federal loans.As the Premier Career Accelerator in Texas, we are thrilled about this news. Adding this layer of compliance and quality assurance will significantly improve the quality of education we provide and the way that we provide it. It will help us abide by our core values of Delivering Excellence, Acting with Integrity, Cultivating Inclusive Growth, and Being Helpful. It will help us live out our mission of empowering life change on a bigger and better scale, so that we can continue to be the #1 option for Texans looking to launch a career in tech!Not familiar with Codeup?

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/inclusion-at-codeup-during-pride-month-and-always/,True,"Jun 4, 2021 | Codeup NewsHappy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/what-are-the-best-jobs-in-2021/,True,"Apr 13, 2021 | Tips for Prospective StudentsEvery year, Glassdoor names the 50 Best Jobs in America. The year is 2021 and would you look at that? The top 2 Best Jobs in 2021 just happen to coincide with the two programs we have at Codeup! A true coincidence? We think not. We know what jobs are in demand, and what jobs will see growth well into the future. Let’s take a look at what these jobs are and why they top the list! The #1 Best Job is not Software Developer, Software Engineer, or Computer Scientist. It is specifically Java Developer. What does this mean?A Java Developer is a developer whose work is largely focused on Java, which is both a programming language and a platform for application development. Many companies, including LinkedIn, Indeed, and Twitter, rely on Java for their websites. Java Developers are responsible for designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining Java applications. Such applications might include gaming websites, e-commerce websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, and more.What you will be by the time you graduate Codeup is a full-stack web developer. You will have learned to build web-based applications using Java, but it isn’t the only tool in your toolbox. You’ll also be comfortable coding with HTML/CSS and JavaScript, and can integrate various coding languages to develop an application. You will know about front-end technologies, back-end technologies, and will be able to work in either one or both. Click here to view our curriculum. Java Developers are much less focused on design, and much more focused on the program architecture. This role has a heavier focus on computer science, and the coding is limited mostly to Java. Codeup students that particularly loved their 100+ hours in Java might decide to specialize, and seek out a Java Developer role.Why is it the best?Glassdoor determined the Best Jobs in 2021 based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. Java Developers have 10,103 job openings on Glassdoor. Most of the other jobs ranked on this list have under 10,000 job openings, and about half have less than 5,000. The median base salary across all levels of Java Developers is $90,830. The overall job satisfaction is 4.2 out of 5. This role is in-demand by employers, rated highly for job satisfaction, and pays very well. The #2 Best Job is not Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, or Business Analyst. It is a Data Scientist.A Data Scientist (capital D, capital S) is a specific role that requires work across the entire data science pipeline. However, there are a number of roles a data scientist (lowercase D, lowercase S) can take! Their job title may not be “Data Scientist” but they can still work throughout the data science pipeline. However, they might choose to specialize in one area based on their own preferences or business needs, and take on a role like a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Analytics Specialist.After Codeup, you will be a data scientist. You’ve been trained and have gained experience working throughout the entire data science pipeline, including data wrangling, which many programs neglect. Our collective goal is for you to be hire-able as a Data Scientist, but many grads end up taking a more specific role. Other alumni job titles include Business Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and People Analytics Specialist. To learn more about the various careers in data science, based on our alumni’s job titles, check out the blog “What Data Science Career is for You?”Why is it the second best?As mentioned above, Glassdoor decides these rankings based on number of job openings, salary, and overall job satisfaction. There are 5,971 job openings on Glassdoor for Data Scientists. The median base salary for Data Scientists of all levels is $113,736. The job satisfaction rating is 4.1 out of 5. This is a very high paying role with high satisfaction rankings. In fact, it topped the Best Jobs list for four consecutive years until 2020! While the number of job openings for Data Scientists may not look terribly high, the growth rate is 31%, which is very high! Keep in mind, too, that Glassdoor is counting the jobs for Data Scientists, and not all the millions of positions that a data scientist might specialize in. There’s certainly a reason these are the two programs we teach here at Codeup! They are the best jobs out there, in booming industries, and in very high demand for employers. They can also offer lots of stability, flexibility, and work-life balance. No wonder they’re the 2 Best Jobs of 2021!Thinking about becoming a Java Developer for web-based applications?

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/annie-easley-scholarship/,True,"Nov 9, 2020 | Codeup NewsWe have an exciting announcement! We’re launching a new scholarship to build and support the Black community in tech. The Annie Easley scholarship is a $1000 scholarship awarded to every Codeup student who identifies as Black or African-American. Read on to learn about our commitment to diversifying tech, our support of the Black community, and Annie Easley! We make an active, ongoing effort to cultivate inclusive growth at Codeup and in the tech field at large. By encouraging diversity in our cohorts, we are contributing to the long-term growth of underrepresented groups in tech when our students join the workforce. We offer need-based Pride, Veteran, Minorities in Tech, and Women in Tech scholarships. While the numbers of female, non-Black minority, and LGBTQIA+ developers are growing, they are still outpacing their Black counterparts. To help support the growth of the Black community in tech, our Annie Easley scholarship is a guaranteed $1,000 to every student who applies for the scholarship and identifies as Black and/or African-American.  In 2018, only 2.7% of professional developers identified as Black. In two years, that number grew by less than 1%. In 2020, only 3.6% of professional developers identify as Black, even though the overall population is 13.4% Black. For some context, 70.7% of developers identify as white.Why do we care? The people building technology should represent the people using technology, and we need to do more to make that happen. Empowering underrepresented developers can increase career opportunities, normalize this career path for rising professionals, and yield more inclusive and equitable technology solutions.  The centuries of racism and the ensuing, long-lasting burdens on the African-American population cannot be undone.  We acknowledge that there are built-in hurdles that Black Americans have to overcome that are based on thoughts and ideals resulting from that racism. What we can do is work to level the playing field by softening the financial barrier to entry into tech. Our hope is that a guaranteed scholarship will help facilitate this and open up opportunities. Annie Easley was one of the first Black employees at NACA (now NASA), where she worked as a human-computer, computer engineer, and rocket scientist from 1955-1989. She wrote the code for the computer program that controls the fuel mixture of the Centaur rocket, which went on to successfully launch several space probes and is still being used today. Additionally, her work on energy conversion systems and alternative energy technology was used to develop the batteries used in modern hybrid vehicles. Easley has also co-authored several papers on nuclear power plants and rocket science.In 1977, she went back to school to get a degree in Mathematics while working full-time, where she raised awareness about NASA and inspired many women and minorities to pursue STEM careers. Later in her career, she helped supervisors address discrimination complaints as an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor, and fought for women’s rights. Modern spaceflight likely wouldn’t be possible without her, and much of what we know about space might still be unknown. Her work has been monumental not only for African-Americans, not only for women, not only for programmers, but for technology as we know it. That is why we’re naming this scholarship and our next Data Science cohort after her. The technology of tomorrow starts today. If you identify as Black or African-American and would like to help build future technology, start a career as a software developer or data scientist!

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/how-to-hire-for-the-long-haul/,True,"Apr 1, 2021 | Codeup News, EmployersWe’re preaching to the choir to say that recruiting, hiring, and training employees costs companies a lot of time, energy, and money. Similarly, losing existing employees causes incalculable losses on institutional knowledge and team morale. Given that 71% of recent college grads leave their first job within their first year, modern employers face a crisis of confidence in hiring employees who are ready to commit. Fortunately, you can hire for the long haul with Codeup candidates that are ready to commit to growing in your company.The average tenure of Codeup graduates in their first job is 22 months (2014-2019), almost double the norm for college grads. That means that for every Codeup grad you hire and employ, you would have to hire and employ TWO college graduates, resulting in more than double your HR costs.53% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are STILL employed at their first company. That means for more than half of your hires, you could hire an employee who sticks with you indefinitely. Between 2014-2021, 90% of Codeup graduates hired after graduation are still employed in their fields of study. More broadly, most people change jobs 12 times throughout their career. You could hire someone who’s about to make 3 more career hops, or you could hire someone who is 9 times out of 10 landing in their final career change.Employers face a shifting workforce with shorter tenure, more job hopping, and less company loyalty, all of which add up to increased costs and decreased performance. Why do Codeup grads differ so drastically?Save recruitment costs, increase employee tenure, and hire employees who want to join you for the long haul. Ready to hire for the long haul?

Job security, good compensation, work/life balance, personal fulfillment – all of these can be found in a career as a developer! There’s lots of demand for them, but not nearly enough of them. Despite stereotypes, web developers can actually find their work very engaging and personally rewarding, and the world certainly needs them. It’s a solid career path, with room for growth – both personal and professional. Keep reading to learn why you should become a web developer! The demand for web developers is ever increasing. There are currently about 1,504,895 developer jobs, and 250,000 of them remain open. The 10-year growth predicted in 2019 was 8%, a rate that’s much faster than the average for all occupations. But the talent pool isn’t keeping up. In fact, Codeup was founded in 2013 by employers that couldn’t find the talent they needed to fill their development roles. This significant gap between supply and demand is a constant stretching from Silicon Valley to New York City, and probably further. For anything you need or need to know, your first touchpoint is the internet. We’ve ditched physical dictionaries and encyclopedias in favor of a Google search. Friendships and networking now exist online, and the activity of “going shopping” has been replaced with e-commerce for everything from electronics, to clothing, to education, even groceries (HEB has been dethroned by Amazon). This stark technical shift isn’t going to go away, especially now that companies have been forced to adapt to doing business online. Every company needs an interactive website with an equally interactive mobile version to stay afloat. While traditionally brick and mortar companies remove storefronts and go paperless, human-facing staff are being downsized in favor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automatic, responsive applications (think salespeople and customer service agents). However, they will always need people to program that AI, code the applications, and protect all the new networks and infrastructure from being hacked. Job security is one thing you won’t have to worry much about as a skilled developer. There truly are not enough in the market, and you can help bridge that gap while also building a fulfilling career! Reason #2 of why you should become a web developer is to have the security and stability you’ve always wanted. As mentioned earlier, the ever-growing need for developers will ensure your job security for years to come, so long as you stay up to date with the newest languages (more on that later). It’s no secret that landing your first developer job is going to be tough. That’s true whether you’re a Computer Science grad, a bootcamp grad, or self-taught. (Codeup does everything we can to streamline your job hunt.) But once you’re in, you will rarely find yourself out of a job. Web developers boast a tiny unemployment rate of 2.5%. That feeling of knowing your skillset will be in demand well into the future is priceless. It’s a career, not a job, and your compensation and benefits will reflect such. Gone are the days of clocking in and out for bathroom breaks, not seeing your family, being called in, and asking to work overtime to get more hours. Welcome to the days of a stable and flexible work schedule, health insurance, retirement contributions, and a good salary! The average starting salaries are:Those are some good looking numbers for your very first development job. And salary offers drastically increase after you pass “entry level.” Average salaries are:Senior Web Developers have at least 5 years of experience, but some companies require more. Even still, there’s potential to nearly double your salary in just a couple years. A few years more and six figures, here you come! Look, coding is tough stuff! You can equate it to learning Spanish, then German, then all of a sudden, French is all the rage. Meanwhile, your colleagues may speak it a little differently than you, using a different word order to deliver the same message. This career path is one of continuous learning and evolution:This career path is for highly motivated individuals that are okay with constant learning, shifting, and growth. Job satisfaction is an ambiguous thing to measure. Some things that go into it are job security, compensation, ability to grow, and personal fulfillment, all of which we touch on here. Other elements are work/life balance, quality of leadership, colleagues, and appreciation from others, which vary from person to person and from job to job. You’ll be happy to know that the majority of developers, at a whopping 63%, are satisfied with their jobs. (That’s much higher than the national average of 51%!) Lots of developers think of their job as a hobby, like mastering an instrument or a sport. It can be very personally fulfilling. For some, they’re creative and innovative. They enjoy being at the forefront of tech and bringing ideas to life. It’s an exciting place to be! Others fully embrace their analytical skills, and love the idea of seeing performance results whenever they run their code. If it runs, fabulous. If it doesn’t, it’s a problem they enjoy solving. Is it frustrating sometimes? Yes. Is it also very rewarding when it finally works the way they intend? Absolutely. Thinking more externally, can the applications you make truly make a difference in someone’s life? Definitely! When you’re a web developer working with the right team toward the right mission, you might love it so much you’d do it for free (hypothetically, of course). So why should you become a web developer? It’s a solid career path with high compensation and high demand that will grant you the stability, security, and confidence we all long for. Going one step further, you can meet your full potential in a position with constant growth and high job satisfaction, where creative minds can embrace their creativity and analytical minds can embrace their problem-solving skills. Feel fulfilled, confident, accomplished, and secure. Start today, be a web developer in 6 months! Apply now!

https://codeup.com/data-science/why-you-should-become-a-data-scientist/,True,"Mar 11, 2021 | Data ScienceWhat do you look for in a career? Chances are, you’re looking for a way to make use of your particular talents, a field that’s secure and reliable, a work/life balance, and good compensation. For the right people, data science offers all of that and more! It was LinkedIn’s #1 Most Promising Job in 2019, and Glassdoor’s 2nd Best Job of 2021! Actually, Data Scientists topped that list from 2016 to 2019 before being dethroned by developers, which we also train at Codeup. So why all the hype? What makes it the best? Keep reading to learn why you should become a Data Scientist! Do your colleagues hate you for overanalyzing things? Have you found yourself turning everything into a spreadsheet? Do you make your life decisions based on careful calculations using past data? You might thrive as a data scientist! This is the first section on our list because data science isn’t for everyone, and it’s important to consider where your strengths and interests actually lie. If you don’t have a penchant for numbers and historical patterns, or if careful analysis bores you, this may not be for you. For some people, though, data science is fascinating, rewarding, and a great way to make use of their talents and natural thought processes. Check out how much our students love what they do every week in this blog post.  The field is booming, the demand is high, and the job is the best. 2020 was the first year since 2016 that Data Scientist was not the number one job in America, according to Glassdoor. Now it sits at Number 2, but rest assured, the growth and demand show no signs of slowing down. Since 2012, there has been a 650% increase in data science positions. However, the supply of data scientists remains relatively low. Sure, it’s been the number 1 job for a while now and people are catching on, but more and more positions are also opening, so supply isn’t actually catching up to the demand. At least, for qualified data scientists.One reason for the continued low supply is that prospective data scientists who go traditional routes are often stuck in school for 2-4 years. Meanwhile, the demands and technologies are changing rapidly, so what they are learning risks being outdated by the time they graduate. Another reason is that a Master’s Degree does not in and of itself prepare grads with the skills needed for the job, or even just to nail their technical interviews. They might learn about data science for years, but if they don’t practice it, don’t have a repository that they push to regularly, haven’t built a data pipeline, don’t have project experience, etc., they aren’t ready to work as a data scientist. This lack of post-grad readiness is another contributor to the low supply, despite many graduate students thinking they’re ready for the job search. (Thinking of getting a Master’s Degree? Learn more, here.) Altogether, this makes a trained data scientist all the more valuable, relatively rare, and in very high demand.So, you know that demand is high now and that properly qualified data scientists (with flexible demands) will have no trouble finding a job. But you don’t just want a job now, you want a career for the long haul. Is this just a trend that’s going to fizzle out? Unlikely. Will this still be a secure path in the future, say 10 or 20 years down the road? All the data say yes!The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics lists Data Scientists as one of the fastest-growing occupations. They project a 31% growth rate with nearly 12 million new jobs between 2019 and 2029. More and more companies will have no choice but to start using data-driven decision making, lest they risk being put out of business by their data savvy competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI), a subset of data science, alone is creating millions of jobs! However, it’s also wiping out over a million jobs. Want to make sure your skillset stays in-demand? Start a career with job security. Employers will always need humans to program the machines, understand the data pipeline, write the algorithms used by AI, and continue maintaining the tech and the data.Many of Codeup’s career transitioners know what it’s like to work in oilfields, call centers, food service, sales, retail, and teaching. The ones that don’t require manual labor or being on your feet all day still require odd hours, lots of emotional exertion, or giving up weekends. Some people love this sort of work, but others are missing that work/life balance. Work/life balance is something that’s completely subjective based on where you are in your life, how much you enjoy your work, how much is required of you, and so on.With a career in tech, you will very likely be working at a desk from 8 or 9am to 5 or 6pm with weekends off. You won’t be manual laboring, rushing to get someone to cover your shift, stressing about getting in hours, or speaking to customers or children all day long. Will some days be more stressful than others? Are you going to have to stay late sometimes to meet deadlines? Will you spend some of your “free” time learning the newest technologies? Yes. But for the most part, you can relax. You’ll have a steady work schedule, an average stress level, above-average flexibility should you need to adjust your schedule or take time off, and you will almost always have evenings and the weekends to yourself or to spend time with family and friends.Interested in boosting your earning potential? Data science is a lucrative field with a highly valuable skillset. You could potentially double your current salary with your very first in-field job. Your employer might also cover health insurance, provide retirement contributions, and offer flexible paid time off. Entry-level data scientists have some of the highest starting salaries around, with averages of:And it’s only upward from there as your career progresses. In San Antonio, which is where our headquarters are, we’re seeing salary averages of:Want to start earning six figures within a few years? Become a data scientist. With just a few years of experience, your talent becomes much more valuable. Keep reading to see how long it takes to advance.In the tech field, room for growth is limitless. There are always new technologies to learn and adapt to, new skills to perfect along the data pipeline, and career opportunities abound. The next step after beginning your career as a Junior Data Scientist is often Senior Data Scientist, which is the middle level. Typically, this requires 3-5 years of relevant work experience and the abilities to write reusable code, formulate machine learning algorithms, and build strong data pipelines in cloud environments. After senior is the top level, the most experienced member of the data science team. You may see them referred to with different titles, such as Vice President, Director, Head, or Chief. They lead the data science team, have over 5 years of experience, and are fluent or very well-versed along the data science pipeline. This person knows best practices for building and deploying a predictive model, can efficiently write code, and will know the highest impact projects to work on (TowardsDataScience). So, you’ve got a booming industry, a secure field, a skill set that’s in high demand, the ability to advance your career, a lucrative salary, a solid work/life balance, and to top it off, you get to do what you’re good at and passionate about. No wonder it’s the best job out there! If you enjoy working with data, this could be an incredibly fulfilling career path. Did you know it only takes 6 months to actually become a data scientist?

Hiring a team of qualified developers that don’t all have the same resume and demographics is even harder. For hiring managers looking to grow their teams with diverse talent, we can help.Diversity in employment isn’t only a simplistic comparison of race and gender. Those are, of course, critical demographics to focus on when leveling the playing field, but they are only two. People often forget about other variables like age, educational background, military service, physical ability, and work history. Hiring diverse talent means more than splitting your team 50/50 and calling it a day; it means introducing and empowering as many divergent identities, experiences, and perspectives as possible.Take a minute to reflect on your own team. How many non-male individuals are there? How many non-white and non-male individuals work on your team? Do you work alongside any military veterans? Have you interviewed any LGBTQIA, alternative education, or disabled individuals? When you expand your definition and begin to think about the intersectionality of identity, building a diverse team gets a lot more complicated than hiring out of a CS program.We don’t have the perfect solution – nobody does. But one of Codeup’s core values is to Cultivate Inclusive Growth, and we are committed to learning every day how we can empower life change for diverse populations. We’ve seen that building diverse teams starts with building diverse candidate pipelines.    Whatever your barrier to hiring diverse talent, we can help. Reach out to us at partners@codeup.com.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/codeup-houston-bootcamp/,True,"Oct 26, 2020 | Codeup NewsHouston, we have a problem: there aren’t enough software developers! After 6 years of helping adults transition into tech careers in San Antonio, and 1 year of operating in Dallas, it’s time to launch our Houston bootcamp. What better place to expand to than Houston, the largest city in Texas, and one of the top five largest cities in the country? In Houston, the demand for tech talent is high, the population is vast and diverse, and Texas still has the 10th largest economy in the world. With a commitment to placing our graduates in real tech jobs, we go where the demand is and where our employer partnerships lead.  Launching a new campus during this pandemic won’t change much from the student perspective. Just like before, people from all across Texas can enroll in our programs, and classes will continue to be remote until it is safe to open our campuses. However, with a physical presence in Houston, we will be able to better expand our employer partnerships and build our network so our Houston bootcamp students can get the best experience possible! You can become a software developer after 22 weeks in our virtual Full-Stack Web Development program. Classes are conducted live via Zoom along with your classmates. Interested in building custom applications? Learn more about how to bring your ideas to life with Codeup here.While we won’t officially be launching our Houston bootcamp with a Data Science program, people all across Texas still have the rare opportunity to attend the Data Science program that’s based out of San Antonio, since that is also virtual. Take advantage of this while you can- virtual classes are only a limited time offering! Interested in using data to deliver actionable insights and make informed decisions? Learn more about launching a career in data science here.Watch out, Houston! Now you’ll be launching rockets and careers! We’re very excited to now be operating in three cities, and equally excited that anyone across Texas can take advantage of it! Want to see what we’re all about?

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/college-in-decline-and-bootcamps-on-the-rise-amid-covid-19/,True,"Jan 29, 2021 | Codeup NewsQuestioning college? You and apparently millions of others! The COVID-19 pandemic has seen college in decline and bootcamps on the rise as people flock to shorter-term options that offer a clear career path and a marketable skillset. For some, it’s the newfound financial strain causing them to realize they need a new career ASAP and can’t spend 4 years and $50k to get it. A recent Wall Street Journal article even wonders, “Is This the End of College as We Know It?” Keep reading for our interpretation. College is generally accepted as the thing to do after high school, but it wasn’t always that way. The “college for all” campaign originated during the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s, when college was a luxury for the rich. It caused a racial and classist divide as those that couldn’t afford it took on trades. However, college is still a luxury for the rich. Only now, those that can’t afford it have to fight for scholarships and grants or bear the burden of student loan repayment for three, four, sometimes five or more decades. Thanks to student loan repayment, many feel forced to postpone life milestones, unable to finance a house or children while catching up on debt. In the midst of a pandemic, that financial strain is a risk people are more hesitant to take.What’s the point of college, anyhow? Why insist that everyone should go even if it causes financial strain for decades? Well, because it’s supposed to give us the education we need to be successful, prepare us for the working world, and get us to a job where we can make use of our degree right after college. For the lucky few, that actually happened. The rest didn’t get the Return on Investment they hoped for. After college, they struggled to find their way, often winding up in career paths that don’t require their degree, but all the while, continuing to pay for it. A promised not delivered? Not exactly, because there was never a legal promise, just advice from everyone around them. An unfortunate debt and learning experience? Some may call it that.So if not college, then what? Many are going against the grain, saving tens of thousands of dollars and years of their life in the process. Who’s profiting? Institutions that offer short-term training in a marketable skill, and their students. The pandemic has loomed upon us for about a year now, and in that year, short-term credential classes saw an enrollment spike of 8 million students, a 70% increase from just before COVID-19. Meanwhile, enrollment of freshmen in college dropped 16%. Going this route, even students are profiting, as they’re able to start earning income much faster.While short-term classes in more traditional trade careers, like electricians, mechanics, plumbing, and some health care professions have been around since 1879, coding bootcamps are really at the heart of this spike. They’re newer and more enticing to the emerging adults of Gen Z. They help millennials right the wrongs of their post-grad plans not working out. Even older generations are seeing the shift to a technical world and want in. Our aim here at Codeup is to develop the workforce, our mission to empower life change. While we can’t speak to any other coding schools’ mission, their aim is more or less the same. College provides a place to learn while coding bootcamps and trade schools provide a clear path into a career. College provides an often broad and philosophical education, covering a wide array of topics like history, science, and liberal arts, with a focus on whatever we are interested in. Coding bootcamps and trade schools prepare you for one thing and one thing only, with a focus on in-demand careers. It’s everything you need to know, and nothing you don’t.Currently in college and feeling stuck? Transition out with Codeup, where you can start your career 10X faster!

Is it a Senior Developer with experience in CI/CD and streaming over web sockets? Nope. But you are consistently getting a developer who has 670+ hours of full-stack development experience, pair programming skills, learning agility, professionalism, and grit. Every time. Will it always be a perfect fit? No. Even when counting cards, there are no absolutes, but you can still play a much smarter hand. On top of those baseline qualifications, you are sourcing candidates from a pool of hungry and motivated developers, in which your future CTO or Lead Developer might be floating. Our grads stay with their first company for an average of 24 months.  In an industry where roughly a 1 year tenure is the norm, that’s twice as long as most! They have been through life’s ups and downs, and they’re looking for a place to make a difference. Maybe you’re hiring your next lead, senior, or chief engineer! True, you might be hiring someone who doesn’t fit your culture or pace or tech stack or any other number of reasons employees don’t fit. You will always face risk, you know that and we know that. But when it doesn’t work out, we give you your money back. We boast an industry-first Salary Refund Guarantee: let go of a Codeup graduate within two weeks of hiring them and we will reimburse 100% of their payroll. With a best-case scenario of your next CEO and a worst case of a cash refund, are you ready to buy in?

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/oops-i-got-a-degree-in/,True,"Dec 14, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsIs your degree not getting you the job prospects you hoped for? Having doubts about college? Accidentally study Wizardry for four years? We have heard many stories about degrees that didn’t pan out long term. At our event “Oops I Got a Degree In…,” Codeup Data Science alumni Nicole Garza and Jesse Ruiz were living proof that your degree doesn’t have to box you in. Our Director of Marketing and Admissions, who studied Health and Exercise Science, led a discussion on how their seemingly non-relevant degrees got them to where they are now. Keep reading to see how Jesse went from Ivy League graduate to Codeup alumna, and how Nicole went from interning for the mayor to building up a data science department. Nicole: My name is Nicole and I have a degree in Political Science with a minor in Sociology.Jesse: I’m Jesse. I have an undergraduate degree in Philosophy, then studied Fine Arts in graduate school. Nicole: I interned for the mayor’s office, but you need a certain personality type to do politics. I’d rather be behind a screen.Jesse: I was an artist and taught art. It was a really fun and amazing opportunity but it wasn’t financially secure.  Nicole: I did some jobs where I had to work with data, descriptive statistics, and a database. Then I got interested in pursuing that at a higher level.Jesse: With my degree in Philosophy at an Ivy League, I got lots of training in analytical thinking and study habits. I did well in calculus and physics, and being an artist took a huge amount of self-discipline and creativity. I see all of those things largely in data science. Nicole: Both my brothers are developers, and software developers are a great resource to help understand the coding part of data science. Some courses in my undergrad had a heavy emphasis on research, data, and statistical analysis and I remembered that I enjoyed those.Jesse: I started searching for other career opportunities and took a lot of quizzes about what the best career is for your personality. I did a lot of research in the field and consulted my cousin who is a software developer. It took me about a year of part-time self-teaching for me to actually understand the field. Nicole: Take a short online class to see if it’s something you’d perhaps enjoy. Something very simple and basic. Talk to people in the field. Think about past courses or experiences that you enjoyed or were good at. Jesse: Take a predetermined period of time taking some courses and harnessing your network. Talk to your cousin that’s in the field, or the career services at your alma mater to think through your options with someone else. Nicole: The job I was at before Codeup wasn’t for me. It was very repetitive and I wanted something different, more creative, something that would get the wheels of my mind turning. I started researching options and wanted something that started at a beginner level. Then shortly after, Codeup announced their new data science program. I did some research on it, took the tests and the rest is history!Jesse: It takes a leap of faith. At the time, I was going through some health issues. I was worried about not having health insurance and living at home with my mom and barely making enough money. Codeup has done a great job of helping students work through even the really serious aspects of the decision-making process. I gave myself a year of researching and studying, and then I got funding. When I got funding there was no turning back, I was gonna do this. I think about if I would have done the program if I didn’t have funding, probably. The cost is scary. But if you spend enough time thinking about it, considering the field, and introspecting about where you want your personal life to go, I think that’s what it takes Nicole: When I first started at the company I’m at now, they were just using Excel to do everything and used zero coding. So, I came in and they really relied on me to help innovate and change things. I started changing a lot of the processes from Excel over to Python and R but I was afraid that I was not doing things correctly because I was new to the field. I was scared I was kind of leading the company in the wrong direction or something. But I double, triple checked everything I did and made sure it’s right. Now, we’ve been growing and the company has more than doubled in size!Jesse: Finding a job afterward is very stressful and uncertain. Once you start working, you kind of go back to lots of learning and adjusting. Sometimes in my new team that I’m on, I feel like there are moments I don’t really know what I’m doing. But it’s obvious to me that no one knows everything, and I can know things that more experienced or senior people might not know and that’s okay. So no, I haven’t experienced it that much. Nicole: I work at Guardian Premier Solutions. I think they found me through the Codeup Alumni Portal and contacted me. We interviewed for 30 minutes, and within one week they asked when I can start. We monitor psychological and physiological data through devices and tests to determine the best type of military training candidate. That’s something I’ve really been enjoying, and I really enjoy my coworkers as well. They really value input and new ideas, and I love that. Really grateful for this job, it’s been really great. Thanks, Codeup! Jesse: Initially out of Codeup, I worked with a small boutique consulting firm, I was a contractor developing Excel macros. I was there short term and then got a job at USAA, also as a contractor. I was working on a team that was doing some design work and making presentations. Then, I transferred to a team that did data reporting, then to a team that did machine learning. I became a full-time employee and now get benefits. Honestly, everything’s been great and I’ve achieved everything I wanted to out of Codeup, which includes moving out of my mom’s house! I’m living a more stable life now. Overall, it’s been really great.  Hopefully, these stories serve as inspiration to not put yourself in a box simply based on your degree! The tech field is welcoming to anyone that can learn the skills, no matter their educational background.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/how-codeup-paid-off-for-both-employee-and-employer/,True,"Feb 10, 2021 | Codeup News, EmployersAfter graduating from Codeup in 2016, Stan H. was hired on by a digital media company called Lifeblue in Plano, TX. He made the move from San Antonio to Plano and has been working there ever since. With our recent expansion to Dallas and a successful 4-year employment, we were curious: Was attending and hiring from Codeup worth it? We interviewed him and his boss so you can learn how Codeup paid off for both employee and employer!Stan: I was living in San Antonio at the time and looking for a way to refresh my skills and become more marketable in the IT sector after working overseas for a long time. Codeup was the most attractive option and was right in the city.  Stan: Be honest with yourself about your skill set and don’t be afraid to ask questions to senior devs at the company. Even if those questions perhaps seem like things you think you should know or you think they expect you to know. Don’t let imposter syndrome get the best of you. If the company knows you came from a coding bootcamp, they should know that you are not the finished product and will require mentoring. Having said that, it is up to you to make sure you get that mentoring and ensure you keep on improving and building on top of what you learned at Codeup.   Stan: I think one of the biggest advantages that a Codeup grad has is having Codeup in their corner. All of Codeup’s resources, like contacts of potential employers, and the knowledge of what the industry is looking for and overall demands that need to be met, make getting your foot in the door much easier. You get added resume prep. You’re usually also better prepared. Collaboration experience of working on a project is another advantage a Codeup grad might have over another candidate.   Stan: Many Codeup grads have some sort of prior work and more life experience.  Stan: Getting to work on a diverse and ever challenging set of projects and do it all with a truly fantastic group of people.  Stan: The best part of Codeup was that it provided me with exactly what I hoped for and what Codeup said it could provide: the opportunity and means to attain a career as a web developer. Looks like the Codeup investment paid off! Employers investing in new developers find that the character and drive that got our alumni through Codeup is also what they like to see on the job! Four years later, it’s still paying off. For the employee, the Codeup investment has the power to not only change your career, but the trajectory of your whole life.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store!

https://codeup.com/web-development/co/codeup-news/inclusion-at-codeup-during-pride-month-and-always/,True,"Jun 4, 2021 | Codeup NewsHappy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/succeed-in-a-coding-bootcamp/,True,"Jun 22, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWe held a virtual event called “How to Succeed in a Coding Bootcamp” featuring our Dallas-based Full-Stack Web Development instructors, Douglas Hirsh and Fernando Mendoza. To start our incoming students off on the right foot, we wanted to hear what advice they have to optimize a coding bootcamp experience. Check out their top tips below!“Practical information and practical skills are going to be acquired by practicing every single day.” – FernandoPractice is an essential part of learning something new. You could watch people bake all day long, and still not be any better of a baker yourself. That’s why our students spend more time actually writing code than listening to lectures. You’ll practice alone, with your cohort, and with instructor guidance. Through this practice, you will change the way you think and approach problems. The instructors agreed that practicing on your own through fun side projects, like creating a program to organize your baking recipes, sets the most successful students apart from the rest. “The reason Codeup is every weekday from 9-5 is because we need you to be fully invested. If you only coded on weekends or in your free time, you would forget everything you saw last time and wouldn’t be able to build upon what you know.” – FernandoDon’t just practice. Practice consistently. Many of our students have tried the self-taught route and eventually ended up at Codeup. Why? Practicing every now and then doesn’t cut it when it comes to something as complex as programming, the same way practicing every now and then isn’t how you learn a language or an instrument. The way to succeed at something is by practicing it frequently and consistently. It’s no different for how to succeed in a coding bootcamp. Codeup is fully immersive for that very purpose. “The best thing you can do is the prework that we assign.” – DouglasHelp your future self by doing the prework assigned before the first day of class.. This isn’t just busy work. It’s for you and only you. We won’t take a grade on it, it’s really, entirely, to set yourself up for success. We will move incredibly fast and it will feel like drinking from a firehose, even if you did do the prework. Do future you a big favor by getting used to what drinking from a firehose feels like! “Replace frustration with curiosity, then experimentation.” – FernandoAs you consistently practice the prework, you will come across errors. Instead of getting frustrated, let the errors trigger your curiosity of “why isn’t that working?” and “how do I get it to work?” You can google the keywords in the error message and figure out what to do. This gives you practice problem solving on your own instead of immediately asking someone else for help. While we love helping our students, we will expect you to have already tried to figure things out because we believe in your ability to problem solve. When you do need help, this process helps you frame your questions. We won’t give you answers, but we will happily point to a different way of thinking about an error. It will make getting it right that much more satisfying. “We want you to be in the mindset of understanding and not discovery. The prework is what takes you there.”- FernandoProblem solving your way through the prework allows you to be an active participant in your own learning. You’re giving yourself exposure to a topic before class so that during the lecture, you’re not discovering something new, but trying to understand it. You might not get it the first time you see it, but now you know what to look out for in the lecture. “Think about where you were 5 weeks ago. Use evidence over time that things have gotten better rather than dwelling on failure in the moment. Failure is learning. Failure is good.” – DouglasAs you progress through the program, you will face obstacles and failures, and you will doubt yourself as a programmer. When you feel like you can’t do something, compare yourself to who you were and what you could do 5 weeks ago, instead of comparing yourself to “real programmers.” After reminding yourself of your progress, think about what obstacles are keeping you from moving forward and how to overcome them, instead of defaulting to “I can’t.” Kevin Kelley once said, “Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.”“We have you do group projects and paired programming projects and you get a lot of really good experience working with people remotely. It’s a really good skill to have.” – DouglasProgrammers are not in a room alone all day with 10 screens in front of them. They are frequently communicating with their team, with different teams, and with different clients. You’ll need to know how to storytell and how to present your work and yourself. Throughout the course, you will frequently be working with others and presenting to others.

Our workshops will give you exposure to code, and our panels will let you hear the perspectives of people who made the same career change you’re hoping for. You got this!

Whether you’re just beginning to learn or you’ve been programming for years, you’re going to run into roadblocks and get stuck. Our Data Science Instructor, Ryan Orsinger, has seen 36 cohorts of students come through Codeup and helped build their problem-solving skills through live, audience-centered lectures. Check out his recipe for success below:You’re learning to code, learning the syntax for a programming language, and working on thinking programmatically. The lesson or lecture is completed and now you’re now facing a programming problem that is expecting you to understand and apply the new content. 1. With intent, read the curriculum and the code examples.2. Go back and deliberately read the example code very closely and slowly.3. Copy any example code into your editor.4. Run the example code5. Observe results. Think about each piece of code. What is it doing, what did you expect it to do?6. Try modifying the example code so that you change variables to see different results (one at a time…)If the example code demonstrates how to make a loop from 0 to 9:7. Try removing as many moving pieces from the code for the new concept as possible… try to isolate a unit of work that uses the new concept and test it in isolation8. Read the first exercise problem. Read it slowly, with attention to detail.9. Ask yourself questions about the exercise:10. Work to write code for a smaller problem than the exercise asks.11. If you’re still having problems and stuck, go to step 1.12. If friction, confusion, and “writer’s block” persist, then ask for help from another human being. Explain the steps you’ve already taken, and attempt to ask your question as clearly as possible.

Going remote hasn’t changed that! Two months into this remote world, we thought we’d pause today to explain how we prioritize your success and ensure you get hired. First of all, our career placement services are built on one-on-one relationships. Our Placement team works with students individually to develop a professional portfolio, define a strategy, and conduct a job search. They’ll help perfect your resume, conduct individual career coaching, and prepare you with mock interviews. And they don’t let off until you’ve signed that offer letter! Since we’ve gone remote, our placement team has digitized their curriculum so it’s accessible to all our students, and they’ve continued working one-on-one over Zoom.  Those one-on-one relationships aren’t exclusive to students. It’s the same approach our team takes with their network of hiring managers and recruiters. From curriculum advisory panels to guest speaker lunchtime talks, we involve employers as often as we can. We forge a personal relationship that encourages repeat hiring, open communication, and trust. Lastly, your job search kicks off with a bang in our staple Developer Days and Data Scientist Days. Normally, these are in-person demonstrations of capstone projects that end in a reverse job fair with employers. On April 16th, we hosted our first-ever virtual Developer Day. Over 160 people tuned into it live! Not only did we maintain the quality of the event, but we increased attendance and visibility. That event, especially while remote, kick starts your job search, connects you with employers, and increases your visibility as a candidate. In person or remote, we remain committed to empowering life change and helping our students land jobs in new career fields. If you’ve been affected by COVID-19 in any way (layoffs, health, family, etc), check out our recently announced COVID-19 Relief Scholarship.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/military-veterans-in-tech/,True,"May 22, 2020 | Behind the Billboards, Tips for Prospective StudentsAre you a veteran or active-duty military member considering your next steps? Our alumni have been in your boots. In a recent virtual panel, two military veterans in tech discussed their transition into the field with Codeup: Benny Fields III, a retired Air Force Master Sergeant turned Full Stack Web Developer, and Jeffery Roeder, a Navy Intelligence Analyst turned Data Scientist. Whether you’re interested in Data Science or Web Development, here are some key takeaways from the event. “The GI Bill was a huge plus, but the icing on the cake was the placement program.” – Benny FieldsAfter retiring from the Air Force, Benny Fields took a job as a technical writer, but he quickly became more interested in the software he was writing about than the writing itself. His friend suggested looking into a coding bootcamp, which he did. He liked that Codeup accepts the GI Bill to help military veterans in tech, and the icing on the cake for him was learning about the work our student placement team does to get you hired.“They’ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed. They have tons of connections- it’s crazy. Colleges aren’t gonna do that for you.” – Jeff RoederWe’ll buff up your resume, set up mock interviews, and give you the know-how to nail your interviews and get a job offer. From how to dress, to what to say in a thank you letter, Jeff said it best: we’ll give you every imaginable tool to get placed in a new career. And it’s backed up by our tuition refund.  “They basically tailored their workshop to me. That’s the kinda stuff that Codeup’s gonna do, they’ll get you there!” – Jeff RoederJeff Roeder heard about Data Science classes at Codeup from a friend who had seen our “crazy billboards” (one of which features Benny). He’s a former intelligence analyst, but the admissions process wasn’t entirely a breeze for him. After studying and studying, Python just wasn’t clicking, and he failed one of his technical assessments. He was about to give up on it, but our admissions team wasn’t ready to give up on him. We personally invited him to one of our Saturday workshops where we taught him step by step how to build the foundation he needed. “They were like ‘hey, you’re gonna learn Spanish and you only have six months to do it,’ which is much like going to Codeup to learn something new, you only have six months to do it.” – Jeff RoederWhen Jeff first joined the Navy as a linguist, he was told to learn Spanish in six months. When he joined Codeup, he was told to learn Data Science in five months. They were both immersive experiences where people of different personalities and different cultures joined together for a common goal. As Jeff put it, you may not always like someone or relate to them, but you need each other to accomplish what needs to get done.“Coming to Codeup, I had to be flexible because I had to learn to adapt to new technologies with new people that were way younger than me and were catching on faster.” – Benny FieldsFor Benny, one similarity is that in the Air Force, you have to be flexible. He was used to having a planned day and changing it at the drop of a hat. In the tech field, things are always changing, and flexibility and constant learning are essential. This is where the military flexibility really came in handy for him.Jeff and Benny may have completed different Codeup programs but they both had the same journey from bootcamp to bootcamp. Both failed their technical assessments at first and had to leverage our resources to get through the admissions process. They both worked with our financial aid team to use their VA benefits for the course, and they both left Codeup with a job and a new skillset. Both are now successful military veterans in tech! If you’re looking for your next step and want to learn more about using VA benefits to attend Codeup, talk with our team today!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/a-second-career-start/,True,"Feb 7, 2020 | Tips for Prospective Students      A lot of students enter Codeup from a previous career. We encounter diverse professionals from teaching, military service, the service industry, music, and more. From those prospective students thinking about a change, we often hear concerns like: “I don’t have any technical skills or background,” “I’m just a teacher,” “I’m only a barista,” “I’m only a hobby computer person”…”I could never be a software developer.”       The good news is YOU, the people with a wide variety of non-software development backgrounds, are our specialty. At Codeup, you’ll leverage the qualities that make you good at what you already do, to excel in a new field.      If you’re thinking about switching careers, you’ve probably already followed a plan: you listened to advice from a guidance counselor, went to college, developed a skill set, landed a job, and grew in your role. But maybe you found the day-to-day wasn’t what you expected, that what you’re good at isn’t good for you, or even that you want to learn and grow more. Maybe you need a second start?      With over 574 alumni, we’ve heard that story a lot. We’ve also seen some surprising trends in common careers before entering Codeup. If you want a change but worry about the leap, check out some of the wide-ranging jobs Codeup grads come from and how their skills made them successful in the tech industry: Teacher/Educator Server/Barista Musician/Creative      One of the biggest misconceptions we hear from prospective students is that they are at a disadvantage coming from a non-technical background. In fact, your background, whatever it is, is an ADVANTAGE in learning a new skill and entering the tech workforce. There are plenty of CS graduates, but there are very few Marine-veteran-musician-digital marketers turned software developers.     Want to see for yourself? Hear from our students as they share their career stories, and see how far they’ve gone as developers!      If you’re looking for a second start and see yourself in any of the above careers or skills, we’d love to help you find your passion.

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/what-to-expect-at-codeup/,True,"Oct 1, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsSetting Expectations for Life Before, During, and After CodeupHave you been wondering about whether or not you can keep your current job during Codeup, or if Codeup classes will let you work around certain hours of certain days, or if you really have to apply so far in advance? We get questions like this all the time from prospective students. To make sure you’re successful in your career transition, let’s first set up some expectations about what you can expect before, during, and after Codeup. What is it like to experience life at a coding bootcamp?  The number one, most important, most helpful advice we can give is: do the prework! Give yourself a month to carefully understand and complete the prework we assign when you’re accepted, which was made to help you practice active learning and problem-solving. You’ll soon find that programming is all about practice and getting that muscle memory, like learning to play an instrument. You will thank yourself if you finish it, and risk falling behind if you don’t.In order to complete the prework, you’ll need to apply early. Why? Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You’ll need to be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework. The multi-step application process can take several weeks to over a month. Combining the prework timeframe plus the application timeframe means you should apply seven weeks before your start date. This will also give you enough time to secure grant funding, if applicable, as that also takes about a month to be processed. You can learn more about our application process here.  Codeup classes are full-time, immersive experiences. As a Codeup student, these are the times you will need to be in class: Classes are being conducted daily via live Zoom calls with instructors and other classmates. Optional office hours are held before and after class for additional help. You should plan to spend 20-25 additional hours per week practicing what you learned in class. You should also arrive at your workstation with coffee in tow 30 minutes before class starts so that you can map out your schedule for the day, and review what questions you have going into lecture. Combining office hours, planning, and practicing, you can expect to be occupied from 8am to 7 or 8pm almost daily. Now that you know your new schedule, you can probably see that you won’t have time for much else. Just for a few months, you’ll have to do the bare minimum outside of Codeup. You will need to quit your job. Before joining Codeup, try to save enough money to pay your bills for 6 months. We strongly suggest you avoid working outside of class, as this typically results in poor classroom performance, and we really want you to do well. If you have to work, calculate the bare minimum you need to earn each week in order to get by. Then, spread out your workload to do a little bit here and there throughout the week rather than full days on the weekends, because you do need rest days! The best options are flexible jobs where you’re in charge of your own schedule, such as food delivery, rideshare, dog walking, babysitting, etc. This is not the time to take an overnight shift at your current job or start your own business.You may need to downgrade your living situation to save up. Some students have sold their houses to make this investment possible. Some have moved in with in-laws to save on bills. Some have had to find roommates. Do whatever you can, within reason, to not have to work during Codeup!You won’t be able to adopt puppies, but you can get a fish, try raising plants, or look at pictures of puppies until you can get the real thing after you graduate! The last option is great because you’ll have a reward to work towards, but you have to earn it!Outside classes are also a no-go, but you can watch YouTube videos and documentaries on a new subject you’re interested in. Family and friends may not get to see you as much, but every weekend you can tell them all about what you’re learning and appreciate the time together that much more!Remember, it’s only 6 months of complete dedication to changing your life at a coding bootamp, and then you’ll be thanking yourself for the sacrifices you made!Gone are the days of copying lecture notes word-for-word. (Did that ever work, anyway?) Since you’ll have an online curriculum to read through and refer back to, write notes on what you don’t understand during reading, practice, or lecture. It’s good to track what exactly doesn’t make sense and what you’ve tried that didn’t work so you can ask more targeted questions, whether to peers, Google, or instructors. This way, you’re building yourself a roadmap to follow when you return to your studies each day.Learning how to code is like learning an instrument. Practice, practice, practice. You can do all the reading you want, watch all the video tutorials, and still not know how to code if you don’t actually code. There’s no cramming for exams, no writing research papers. It’s continuous learning and adding to your arsenal through a few additional hours of study/practice every day.In order to make the most of your experience, build on skills, and help yourself for the job search in the long run, you’ll be encouraged to attend meetups, join community Slack channels, and try to meet others in the industry to build your support network, so you have plenty of people to ask for help. You don’t have to go through this alone!  While this sounds totally foreign right now, it will become a daily mantra! Every Codeup student will make an account on a website called GitHub. On a daily basis, we’ll expect you to “commit” code, which means to make a revision to a code file, and then “push” that revision, which, in this case, means to transfer it from your computer to GitHub so that others can keep track of how often you’re coding. This is important to keep up after graduating Codeup to keep your coding skills fresh, and so that potential employers can see that you’re actively working on your craft.Every day between graduation and the start of your job, you should become more valuable and skilled, not less polished and more rusty. The learning never stops, especially not in tech, and especially not in data science! What’s all the rage one year may be out of date the next, and it’s your responsibility to stay on top of the latest technology, programming languages, and practices.We have a whole team dedicated to helping students get jobs! Our placement team will assist you even after graduating. You’ll spend time every day on either finding new listings, touching up your resume and LinkedIn, applying, or interviewing…and that’s in addition to coding every day. You gotta put in the work to find work. Do be prepared to get rejected sometimes, but trust the process. It’s much better to face these mass unemployment rates with a whole team working to get you hired rather than on your own.In summary, you get out what you put in. Our most successful students finished their pre work and made significant life sacrifices to stay focused and committed to the program. Others that weren’t ready, willing, or able to make the changes they needed were unfortunately not able to finish. However, those that do continue to reap the rewards!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/codeup-application-process/,True,"Sep 30, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsCurious about the application process? Wondering why you need to apply so far in advance? You’ve come to the right blog post! From pre-work to technical assessments, to financial aid and interviews, there are a number of reasons you need to apply 1-2 months ahead of your start date. To explain Codeup’s application process, let’s start by working backward. Note: The tilde (squiggly) means “approximately”. After being accepted, every incoming student is given a set of pre-work to do to familiarize themselves with some coding basics. You won’t be expected to have everything memorized, but some exposure will be required for you to hit the ground running on your first week of class. Many have likened our bootcamp to drinking out of a firehose- there’s a lot of ground to cover in 5 months! Completing the pre-work is the best gift you can give yourself in order to soften the blow. Take the start date you are considering, and subtract a month. You should be accepted by that date in order to finish the prework.  Once you’re accepted, you’ll meet with our Financial Aid and Enrollment Manager to discuss your financial aid options. She’s also Codeup’s School Certifying Official for VA Benefits, which take roughly 2 weeks to be processed. Scholarships are awarded about 2 weeks before the first class day, so you will need to have applied for any scholarships before then. Grants can range from 2-8 weeks to be processed and secured, but usually take about a month. You will need to be accepted before applying for grants. The tuition process is finalized in the month leading up to the start date, while you’re also working on prework. Think of this as a casual job interview. We want to make sure you are culturally and behaviorally cut out for Codeup. The intensity and rigor is not for everyone. In this step of the application process, we’re looking for motivated, positive, hard-working, and dedicated character traits. Bonus points if you read our blog post about tips for nailing a video interview!   For Web Development, we will give a couple of technical assessments to test your problem-solving skills. They are not necessarily pass/fail tests, but rather, they help us see how we can best prepare you for class. Those who do not do well on the first challenge have additional opportunities to develop their problem-solving skills. We want to be sure you are set up for success in class! For Data Science, the technical assessments may take much longer as there are more prerequisites, but it varies from person to person. We require a basic level of Python, math, and stats prior to being accepted. How well versed you are in those subjects determines how long this process takes. Could be a week if you were a math major in college, could be months if you’ve never heard of Applied Statistics. Plenty of our students knew nothing about stats or Python before applying but worked through our recommended resources (tutorials and workshops) in order to get to the level they need to be on. Don’t count yourself out! But do be realistic about how long it will take you to learn. If you were to apply for our Data Science program a couple weeks before class starts, knowing nothing about Python or stats, our Admissions Manager will be happy to provide all the necessary resources you need for a future start date, but you may not be qualified in time for the next class start, considering you’d also have to finish pre-work in that limited time. For both programs, we have weekly study sessions with our Teaching Assistants to help you with any material that’s causing you trouble! We may be virtual right now, but we’re still doing virtual campus visits! You can think of this as a program overview. We’ll discuss the admissions process, the curriculum, the schedule, how things are looking now that we’re remote, and any questions you might have. You can think of this as an initial admissions consultation or phone interview, but really we’re just making sure it’s the right fit! Some people think applying for Codeup means getting paid to learn to code, some people think we teach medical coding. This call is just to introduce ourselves, make sure you’re crystal clear on what Codeup is (a full-time career accelerator that trains and places data scientists and software developers), and to answer any questions you might have. The first step in your application process is your application! It’s basically just sending us your name and contact info so we can get the ball rolling on making you a Data Scientist or Software Developer!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/build-your-career-in-tech/,True,"Aug 10, 2020 | Tips for Prospective StudentsBryan Walsh, Codeup Web Development alum, and Misty Garcia, a Codeup Data Science alum, joined Sarah Mellor, Director of Marketing &amp; Admissions, and Stephen Salas, VP of Business Development, in a virtual Zoom event to offer you their insights into building a career in tech. If you’re interested in becoming a Lead Software Developer for a government contractor, like Bryan, or having Misty’s title of Data Management Analyst for a healthcare tech company, keep reading (and watching!) to see how they made that possible.Both panelists were established in their positions before finding Codeup. Misty had been an electrical engineer for 11 years, while Bryan worked in hospitality for 14 years. Both hungry for a change, Bryan found San Antonio before finding Codeup. While answering customer questions about why an application wasn’t working the way it should, Bryan wanted to fix the problems, so he figured out a way to make that his job. Misty, however, first found data science before finding Codeup. Below, Misty discusses what stood out to her about Codeup. Both panelists knew exactly which program they wanted to apply for prior to even finding Codeup, but that isn’t always the case. So, if you’re torn, there are a number of things we’ll help you think about. What are your interests? What is your background in? What are you expected to know before applying vs. before starting? What is your desired timeline? It will really help to talk this out with your admissions manager rather than on your own because you share a common goal, which is for you to succeed in the best program for you. The most important thing you’ll learn at Codeup is how to learn. We can give you a solid foundation in skills like Python or Java, and you’ll learn very quickly. But technology is always changing, and much more important than any singule particular skill is the ability to learn. Here, Bryan hits on how Codeup prepared him to learn new skills that they weren’t explicitly taught in Codeup, but needed on the job. In addition to our curriculum, we also train you on professional development. In the midst of changing career paths so quickly, it can be easy to doubt yourself, or to not know the industry standards and expectations regarding the job search. To help you out, each student is coached professionally, in the ways that Bryan mentions here. In addition to professional development, we also offer job placement assistance. Not only will we help you develop the skills you need to land a job, but our Placement team goes above and beyond to actually make sure you get a job, and that by no means stops after you graduate. Misty didn’t graduate with a job lined up, but still worked closely with the Placement team until she had one. The field of technology is always going to change. You’ll always have to learn new things and you might start to feel like you can’t do it. But Bryan says you just gotta push through. Misty has similar advice, below. Additionally, if you feel like tech is something you can’t do, still apply for Codeup and as you move through the admissions process, allow us to work with you from where you’re at in order to get you to where you need to be. That’s what we’re here for! Be willing! Be willing to be vulnerable, willing to admit what you don’t know, willing to work together, willing to ask for help when you need it. Instructors and admissions staff can’t help you if we don’t know that you need it. But so long as you seek out guidance, even if it means going outside of your comfort zone, we’ll make sure you succeed! And that’s how to build a career in tech! Desire the change, believe in your capacity to do it, follow through with a willingness to learn, and soon enough, you’ll move from entry-level developer to Lead Developer, or from job seeker to helping a company build their first data science team. Codeup is always ready and wanting to help along the way, it just starts with your application! Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-speech-pathology-to-bus/index.php/,True,"Oct 18, 2021 | Alumni StoriesBy: Alicia GonzalezBefore Codeup, I was a home health Speech-Language Pathologist Assistant. I would go from home to home working with children anywhere from 1 year old to 18 years old. After 5 years of the profession, my body was getting tired driving around all the time and I felt overworked. The work was satisfying and I do miss working with the kiddos, but I just felt drained. I knew it was time to find a different field, so I started thinking about what else I was good at.Then one day as I was on my way to a patient’s home, I found a Codeup billboard near Splashtown that said “drive to a job you love” and I took it as a sign. I thought, “I want to drive to a job I love!” I had also heard nothing but good things about Codeup from a friend that went the Web Development route. She answered my questions and helped me through the whole process.At first, I was a little worried about tuition payment, but once I got started in the application process, they held Zoom meetings where they would talk about all the funding options. They made it really easy and addressed all of my concerns. I realized I didn’t have to be scared about the financial aspect. I applied to a couple of grants and was able to get about a third of my tuition covered through the Train for Jobs SA grant from Workforce Solutions Alamo. That really helped me. I also received a few different scholarships from Codeup. The rest of it was a loan from Meritize.It was difficult leaving something I was comfortable and familiar with to start something new with no data science background, but I have always enjoyed all things tech. Once we got into the pre-assessment work and then the prework leading up to class, it showed me, “okay this IS what I wanted to be doing.” I really enjoyed it, thought it was fun, and realized this was for me.Overall, I really enjoyed the program. We were in Zoom the whole time because of the pandemic, but they made it slow, nice, and easy. The instructors are absolutely wonderful. Every single instructor helped me at one point or another, teaching things from ground zero and explaining everything really nicely in a way I can understand. One thing I value the most about the instructors is that, not only do they go over all the necessary skills needed in a data-related career, but they teach us how to learn the skills as well. They didn’t just give us the work and tell us exactly how to do it. They provide instruction, hands-on exercises/projects, and answers to all questions, but most importantly, they walk us through how to work with the data and obtain the answers on our own. This is extremely valuable as I believe it is the key to success in this field.Now after graduating from Codeup, I’m a Business Intelligence Analyst at Liquid Web. I’ve been here almost three months now and I’m contributing to so many projects. I really feel like a true member of the team. I can figure things out for myself and my bosses are telling me how well I’m doing and how far I’ve come since working here. I didn’t have to ask for much help or training, because Codeup prepared me well and taught me how to learn when I run into skills they don’t teach. It’s been really good.I’m so glad I made this change. It was scary to take that leap of faith, but ultimately, I’m really glad I did. I love my job and I love what I’m doing. If anyone is looking to make a career change and struggling to find their best fit, I recommend looking into Codeup and going through their process. I’m extremely happy where I am right now and wouldn’t change a thing.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.

However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

Some students enter with no tech experience, and others enter with a lot. Having programming experience is always a plus, but not a must. However, Data Science relies on experience in math, statistics, and basic programming for all incoming students. You’ll need concepts like working with matrices, writing Python functions, and solving systems of equations. That means that you either need coursework in those subjects, self-teaching experience, or on the job training.Your answer to this question isn’t a simple yes/no, but it should help you determine the ramp-up period to one of our programs and which one fits you better now. If you don’t have any math or programming background, web development may be a better fit. If you have a Math or CS degree, data science may be.Do numbers get you hyped up? Do you love or hate excel? Do you really like programming? Do massive data sets feel intimidating or exciting? Do you enjoy statistics and math? Do you like being visually creative? Do you want to build web applications? Do you want to focus just on technical work or mix technical and business work?This list isn’t exhaustive, but it should kickstart your thinking to explore your intrinsic interest in the content of our programs. Try to understand what each profession does day-to-day, and then ask yourself: which gets me more excited? And make sure your answer is brutally honest! Our programs have the same structures, and both career paths are in demand with great opportunity. You’re in great shape either way, but you’ll be much happier with the content that makes you happy.When you graduate from Codeup, we’ll help you land your first job. From the Web Development program, that likely means a job as a software developer, web developer, or programmer. From the Data Science program, that likely means a job as a data scientist, data engineer, or machine learning engineer. But that’s just the first job! As you move through your tech career, you’ll discover new interests and opportunities, like the following.Web Development: web developer (alternative titles: web designer, UI/UX designer, front-end developer, front-end engineer, full-stack developer, software developer), programming, quality assurance technician, technical sales, product/project manager, etc.Data Science: data scientist, analysts of all kinds (data, business, risk, fraud, marketing, web, competitive), customer intelligence, business intelligence, data engineer, dashboard/data visualization developer, machine learning engineer, etc.You now know what data science and full-stack web development are. You have compared your background skills with our program prerequisites. You have thought about what content gets you more excited! And lastly, you’ve considered what future opportunities you’ll want to open for yourself.Did you decide which program is a better fit? Awesome, congrats! You can apply here and begin your journey to a career you love!Still not sure? Let us help!

https://codeup.com/tips-for-prospective-students/which-program-is-right-for-me/index.php/,True,"Sep 30, 2018 | Tips for Prospective StudentsWith our recent program launch, Codeup now offers two technical career tracks: “Full Stack Web Development – Java” and “Data Science.” If you’re a prospective student, you might be wondering which program is right for you! First, we recommend understanding what data science is and what full-stack web development is. Second, ask yourself the following three questions:One key difference between our programs is the prerequisite background knowledge. Our web development program doesn’t have any required skills! Some students enter with no tech experience, and others enter with a lot. Having programming experience is always a plus, but not a must. However, Data Science relies on experience in math, statistics, and basic programming for all incoming students. You’ll need concepts like working with matrices, writing Python functions, and solving systems of equations. That means that you either need coursework in those subjects, self-teaching experience, or on the job training.Your answer to this question isn’t a simple yes/no, but it should help you determine the ramp-up period to one of our programs and which one fits you better now. If you don’t have any math or programming background, web development may be a better fit. If you have a Math or CS degree, data science may be.Do numbers get you hyped up? Do you love or hate excel? Do you really like programming? Do massive data sets feel intimidating or exciting? Do you enjoy statistics and math? Do you like being visually creative? Do you want to build web applications? Do you want to focus just on technical work or mix technical and business work?This list isn’t exhaustive, but it should kickstart your thinking to explore your intrinsic interest in the content of our programs. Try to understand what each profession does day-to-day, and then ask yourself: which gets me more excited? And make sure your answer is brutally honest! Our programs have the same structures, and both career paths are in demand with great opportunity. You’re in great shape either way, but you’ll be much happier with the content that makes you happy.When you graduate from Codeup, we’ll help you land your first job. From the Web Development program, that likely means a job as a software developer, web developer, or programmer. From the Data Science program, that likely means a job as a data scientist, data engineer, or machine learning engineer. But that’s just the first job! As you move through your tech career, you’ll discover new interests and opportunities, like the following.Web Development: web developer (alternative titles: web designer, UI/UX designer, front-end developer, front-end engineer, full-stack developer, software developer), programming, quality assurance technician, technical sales, product/project manager, etc.Data Science: data scientist, analysts of all kinds (data, business, risk, fraud, marketing, web, competitive), customer intelligence, business intelligence, data engineer, dashboard/data visualization developer, machine learning engineer, etc.You now know what data science and full-stack web development are. You have compared your background skills with our program prerequisites. You have thought about what content gets you more excited! And lastly, you’ve considered what future opportunities you’ll want to open for yourself.Did you decide which program is a better fit? Awesome, congrats!

With live interaction every day, the best coding bootcamp instructors empower each student to change their life. Many try learning a new skill with free modules or self-paced courses to save money, but when you lack that human guidance, what happens when you don’t know what to learn next? What happens when you need more explaining or can’t figure out what you did wrong? What if you lose motivation and start to give up? Live, expert, personalized instruction is what will get you through the hard times and to a new career.If you’re serious about changing careers, you gotta have a good instructor. It needs to be a live, responsive instructor with industry experience, that knows how to teach you what you need to know. You’ll need a curriculum that will actually get you your desired job, based on hands-on practice and skill-building rather than theory. It should cover the entire data science pipeline or app development process to prepare you for the work you will do in-field. The classroom size must be small enough so that you get the individualized attention you deserve. Instructors need to be as invested as you are in setting you up for a successful career and motivate you if you start to give up.Luckily, you can find the best of the best instructors at Codeup. They range in industry experience from entry-level to senior-level. However, even those that are more entry-level may be senior-level educators or senior-level in a particular topic of the curriculum. With a diverse staff of instructors that all shine in different areas of expertise, you’ll have a built-out team that can provide the most value and mentorship to you. Better a full team of experts than a jack of all trades but master of none.Not only will you have expert instructors, but they also really care about you. In college, professors often don’t provide individualized attention, hands-on learning, or accountability. At other bootcamps, you won’t find the same quality of instructors with industry experience, subject matter expertise, and live, interactive lecture and lab. However, Codeup instructors are like personal mentors. They lecture and take questions in real-time. Instead of giving you an answer, they will guide you in the right direction until you understand it yourself. They are all responsive and engaging, with a commitment to your success and a mission of empowering life change. Feel ready to make a career change with a team of mentors to help guide you through it? Your mentor instructors will make sure you understand everything, are there when you reach a roadblock, and will keep you accountable to your learning with project-based assignments on a curriculum inspired by employers.

https://codeup.com/web-development/codeup-alumni-make-water/,True,"Jul 27, 2020 | Alumni Stories, Full Stack Web DevelopmentImagine having a kit mailed to you with all the necessary components to make contaminated water clean. Cool, huh? Four of our alumni are helping to make that possible by partnering with the non-profit Elequa to design a website for their Make Water program. With this project, these Codeup alumni have the potential to make a global impact: Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller. The Make Water program inspires, educates, and equips people that want to make a tangible difference in the world. Elequa puts together DIY kits with the tools to purify water and delivers them to people that need them, locally and abroad. This project is also given to students in the San Antonio area, who in turn are challenged to research, tweak, and further develop the kits to make them better and more accessible. These problem-solving challenges engage students in the STEM field, inspiring teamwork and collaboration while making a difference that they can be proud of: helping to provide clean water.Currently, the Make Water program lacks a platform to house and share the data gathered by students to improve the kits, while also challenging other community members for further development. They needed help with the gamification of these processes to make participation more engaging. That’s where Codeup alumni Jacqueline Murralles, James Murralles, Ted Zamarron, and Carlos Teller came in. They are helping Elequa to build an open-source application for the Make Water program that turns community participation into a game where users can level up as they contribute and collaborate through an array of real-world challenges in water research, coding, hardware innovation, and creative storytelling.Did we mention that they are working on this project as volunteers, as Codeup alumni often do? Codeup students are always looking for ways to challenge themselves, sharpen their skills, and make a difference, and that continues after graduation.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/path-codeup-coding-bootcamps/,True,"Nov 14, 2018 | Alumni Stories I looked at Codeup for 2 years before I finally made the decision to apply. As a requirement for my Math degree, I took an Intro to Java class. I enjoyed it so much and was tempted to switch majors. However, I was a semester away from graduation and decided not to. Coding was still something I wanted to do so I tried some online courses. The online classes were satisfactory, but it made me realize two things: 1) I didn’t know what I needed to be learning and 2) whatever I did learn, I needed to be in a classroom setting to learn it. I heard about Codeup and other coding bootcamps and added myself to Codeup’s mailing list. However, both the price and the thought of having to quit my job scared me from ever applying. I found a cheaper coding school and attended one of their coding workshops, but didn’t like the way the workshop was run. The instructors only gave us lines of code to write with little theory behind it. That combined with poor organization in general made me realize that was not the place for me. I went back to Codeup’s website and read about their curriculum. I liked how theory as well as practical usage was taught. I was also liked seeing how much help was available to students from instructors and student fellows. However, the biggest question still on my mind was, “Will I get a job afterwards?”I learned that the curriculum at Codeup is developed with input from tech companies, which means that Codeup is teaching important skills that employers are actually looking for. Incidentally, the curriculum changed a bit a few months before I started due to employers’ requests. An added bonus on the job front was an in-house liaison between students and employers. Codeup’s Director of Product, Stephen Salas, has connections with several companies and he always know which ones are looking for developers fresh out of school. I decided to take a chance and applied even though I was still worried about the financial part of it. When I got accepted, I found out that there are many scholarships and programs to help ease the financial burden. I qualified for some of these even though I thought I wouldn’t. Many more scholarships and grants have been added since I left Codeup thus lowering the barrier to attend. I graduated in May 2018 and am currently working as a developer specializing in data extraction and transformation. I love what I’m doing now. My only regret is that I didn’t do this sooner.[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

It was a great experience that made me feel right at home. Solving problems, planning, and developing projects all aligned perfectly with my passions and hobbies. Out of the 670+ hours spent developing, there were moments when I would feel the stress, frustration, and discouragement when my source code wouldn’t produce my expected outcome. However, I believed in my abilities and persevered. I continued to work diligently on every project until it was successfully complete. The hard work wasn’t easy, but it was extremely rewarding. It is commonly said, “If you love what you do, it won’t feel like work” and I truly what I love to do! I can honestly say that my career is my passion. The impact this program has had on me is unforgettable. I’ve left this program with a new career, knowledge, experience, and skills; but also friends that share the same passion as myself. It was beyond my expectations. I am extremely grateful for the friendships created, the instructors who always had time to help, and the staff that solidified this entire experience. My drive and passion have led me here and I’m eager to embark on this journey to keep learning and continue developing. Are you ready to discover your passion?

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-the-service-industry-to-software-development/,True,"Oct 8, 2018 | Alumni StoriesBy Randi MaysFor many teenagers, the path to self-reliance starts in one of two places: a restaurant or retail store. Until it’s time to begin a professional career, you’re working that part-time job stocking shelves, helping irate customers with expired coupons or prepping for the dinner rush. I’d venture to say I’m one of the very few who was sad to leave that lifestyle behind.I worked in the food service and retail industries for 10 years before I attended Codeup. I took great pride in my work every day; I couldn’t go home until everything was near perfect: my work area spotless, the shelves neatly stocked and everything ready for the next shift. When it came time to leave the service industry and move on to professional work, I was initially reluctant. I had found great personal fulfillment and success in customer service. Why would I want to leave? I have big dreams. Of course I want to travel the world, spending my vacations in exotic destinations, trying new foods, seeing centuries-old architecture, and making lasting memories. But more importantly, I wanted to work for a company with a more widespread mission than gastronomic satisfaction. I wanted to work alongside people with a passion for their work that ran far deeper than a paycheck.After graduating from Codeup in September 2016, I began working for USAA as a software developer and I can tell you–the company is no stranger to giving. Each employee receives company paid volunteer hours and I used some of mine to volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank among dozens of other USAA employees. Last year when Hurricane Harvey hit, USAA was quick to organize several volunteer sessions at their home campus to prepare food and other basic necessities to be delivered to people in need. They even have a system where I can automatically deduct a specified amount from my paycheck to give to charitable causes I am passionate about. I have heard story after story about their representatives on the phone going above and beyond their duties to serve members in combat zones and at home. I can’t enumerate here all of the reasons I admire USAA for its community involvement and caring, but I’m sure I’ve made my point.There are times I look back on my experience in food service and retail nostalgically, remembering how I excelled in those positions and enjoyed the repetitive work. Then I come back to the present and remember how big an impact my employer makes serving the military community and their families, and how many lives are changed by the work I do with my team. I find great personal satisfaction and pride in my work every day, and I am just getting started.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-bootcamp-to-bootcamp-how-i-found-purpose-through-coding/,True,"May 30, 2019 | Alumni StoriesWhen I was 17 years old an Army recruiter came along and convinced me that the military was a good choice and could afford me many great opportunities in life. At the time I was living a carefree life with a close friend. I hadn’t considered what the next year of my life would look like, let alone the next decade. I didn’t really see myself as a soldier, but I was strongly encouraged to enlist and so I did. It was during this time that I began playing around with building websites. I was far from good at it, but I enjoyed it, a lot.In April of 2018 I found out about coding bootcamps. I had never considered that I could make a living as a web developer. I didn’t even know what a web developer did. But it turns out that developers do the things that I enjoyed so much that I stayed up all night doing them. At the time I was managing a small cafe, making $11 an hour. I was also a part-time uber driver to help make ends meet. It sucked, big time. It was at this time that I made the best decision I’ve ever made. I quit that job and decided to focus on teaching myself how to code while I researched coding bootcamps that would allow me to use the remaining months I had left of my GI-Bill. It was important to me that the school be reputable, care about their students and have a solid track record of getting students a job. Codeup met all those requirements.Before attending Codeup, I decided that if I was going to risk the time and money it would require to improve my life and take a chance on something I knew I truly enjoyed I’d have to do some things differently. I was going to have to give it 110% because if I failed at this I didn’t want there to be any possibility that it was because I held anything back.I like to think that my military training kicked into overdrive.While at bootcamp, I arrived hours early, sometimes turning on the lights myself. Many evenings I stayed late to study and work on projects. I took pride in everything I did, making each and every project better than the last and paying attention to the details. I stayed positive, took care of myself and made coding my life. I hardly watched any television at all, one of my favorite pastimes. I also developed some amazing friendships. I continuously modified my time and intentions at Codeup to shape the best outcome possible.Needless to say, this time around I was ready for it and bootcamp was one of the best experiences of my life.  Currently I work for Cognizant. It’s the best job I’ve ever had. It feels just like Codeup where I was constantly learning and loving every second of it. I work with all the friends I made at Codeup and the salary is… well, like everything else, a dream come true.There’s absolutely nothing I would change about my experiences -Army bootcamp or coding bootcamp. I know without a doubt that because I attended both, I’m living my best life!Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-a-recent-college-grad-to-software-developer/,True,"Sep 28, 2018 | Alumni Stories, Behind the BillboardsI take pride in my bachelor’s degree. Starting my computing career at Trinity University has proven to be extremely important; all the hours spent on algorithm design, data structures, logic are all essential in what I’m doing now. However, it is not an uncommon idea that what colleges teach can sometimes be an offset to industry demands. I experienced this significant gap between employer expectations and my computing skill-set post-college, and with the I-need-a-job-to-get-experience-to-work-for-a-job-that-requires-experience catch that most college graduates experience the first few years of leaving academia, I found myself struggling to find employment. The first year of leaving my university was a humbling yet soul-crushing experience. Why is it that I’ve pursued a degree directly related to such a hungry market for software developers, but I am unable to find a job? Among what seemed like an endless stream of interviews in which I partook, I began to notice a trend – I lacked full-stack development experience with relevant programming languages that are currently in demand. Turns out, having theoretical knowledge isn’t enough for most employers in the market. The industry of software development has evolved throughout the years of its existence, and with its evolution came new programming languages that better suit the needs of its users and the customers it will eventually serve. Ultimately, logical thinking did not trump most self-taught HTML, CSS, Javascript developers that fill the market with highly innovative ideas and projects.As a Trinity graduate who still lived in San Antonio after graduating, I learned more about Codeup from peers who contributed to the curriculum and program’s growth. Some of my classmates in my department also attended the program and found great opportunities within the industry upon graduating from the program. At first, I was skeptical of the value Codeup could bring to someone like me who already had experience in programming, albeit in languages that weren’t exactly in demand. But, being unemployed and discouraged for seemingly an eternity, I decided to give it a go.The program was an introduction to programming, which is very different from my experience in college. Since I was verbose in the structure and characteristics of software development, it was easily digestible. The curriculum consisted of introductions to different programming languages, and most importantly, showed me how everything pieced together to form working and aesthetically pleasing products that definitely had the potential to be client-facing projects that serve the public. It was an eye-opening experience for me: seeing and experiencing web development with relevant technologies like MVC, ES6, and the Spring Framework. As most of the course material was quickly grasped by my existing mode of thinking, I spent most of my time on the assignments, perfecting them and pushing myself to create difficult effects or programs. The instructors were all extremely helpful and understanding of my background, and were even nice enough to provide me with bonus assignments to push what I’ve learned to its limits.I never would have guessed that Codeup would benefit me in the way it did. Within a week of graduating, I found a job as a Salesforce Developer at a consulting company here in San Antonio. Together with the knowledge I’ve obtained from my degree, I have put everything I learned at Codeup to use: creating real products used by thousands of real users. I wouldn’t be here without the experience I had, not just with the curriculum, but with the excellent career placement staff at Codeup. As cliché as it may sound, the benefits I’ve gotten from the program that acted as supplements to my degree don’t fall far from being life-changing, and I would encourage those who have experienced the same struggles as me in this competitive market to give it a go.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

I have had a lot of random odd jobs before going to Codeup, everything from customer service, to logging, to a cruise ship deckhand, to bartender.”What made you interested in coding? And what made you decide to pull the trigger and look for ways to make it your career?“I was in Military Intelligence in the Army, and when I transitioned out, I decided to stay in intel and went to UTSA to get a CS degree to be in Cyber Security.”How did you end up coming to Codeup?“I was bottlenecked in my degree plan (required to take a few prerequisite classes before I could proceed with my degree) at UTSA and decided that I didn’t want to spend another three semesters trying to get passed those classes. Codeup cut that time significantly for a very similar outcome at a cheaper price, so that’s what I chose.”What has your experience been like here?“Very challenging, but rewarding as well. My classmates were always there for each other when we needed help and generally went out of our way to help. That along with the enormous amount of knowledge made it a difficult but enjoyable experience.”What would you tell people considering a career in software development?“Practice. Without consistent practice, it is beyond difficult to learn and just as hard to retain. Keep programming even when you don’t need to. Learning doesn’t stop when class is over or when you’re graduated. You have to constantly stick with it.” __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   Alex Ahrens is a software developer in San Antonio, TX. __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Are you ready to explore the world of tech and the possibilities of a new career?

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/from-cooking-steaks-to-cooking-code/,True,"Nov 5, 2018 | Alumni Storiesby Alexander BousGrowing upIt would be an understatement to say that the bar of expectations were set high as the youngest of 4 to immigrant parents, who were also mechanical engineers. Eldest: Entrepreneur with several successful businesses; Second: Contract Law Lawyer; Third: Doctor of Neonatal Genetics; Fourth (Me): cooked since I was 15. Although the decision to make a career of cooking didn’t hit me for a few years, I had known that I did not want to follow the footsteps of my parents or siblings.CookingAt the age of 19, I decided that I wanted to attend college at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America (CIA). Before I could finalize my decision, I knew I had to tell my parents. They reacted just as I thought they would. “What?! NO, NEVER! Never in my life did I ever think my son would become a cook.” Our family comes from a culture where there are three acceptable career paths: Doctors, Lawyers, and Engineers. Coming from a family where I already had a sibling fulfilling each of those roles, I felt that I had nothing to prove to anyone except myself. I ended up attending CIA and working in the industry for 15 years. Having held every role in a kitchen and marriage, including being a parent, I decided it was time to put my ego aside, think about what’s best for my family, and transition careers.The Most Important ThingEarly on in my cooking career, I had a mentor that drilled a simple phrase into my head: “The most important thing in life is to figure out what is most important.” This simple saying spoke very loudly to me; how can you work towards a goal if you don’t know what the goal is? Every task I would work on in life would ring those words in my head; So what was most important to me? “A happy family and nothing else” is what I have defined as what is most important. Now it’s time to figure out how to get there.The First Step: Codeup Open HouseAfter spending too much time on autopilot, it was then that I realized the only thing keeping me in the restaurant industry was that it was the only thing I really knew. I needed to break the mold to be able to achieve the most important thing. Having always been computer savvy and a self-proclaimed problem solver, I soon realized that I was better with computers than I thought. It seemed to come more naturally to me than others, which was when I realized I needed to find a career that would allow me to use my skills in computers. There was only one clear answer for me, and that was Codeup. I spent time at their open house, and I was sold. Not only were they kind and caring individuals, but also extremely smart and talented developers and teachers. It seemed like the right answer.The Second Step: “Good”After getting through the admissions process and getting accepted, I decided to make the best of my decision to attend and set a plan of action to take in as much as possible. I made note cards, studied ahead, built random projects I found online, and ran code kata’s everyday. Sounds impressive, but I can assure you, there was much failure involved. If I was struggling, “Good” would tend to be my response because with failure comes the opportunity to get better; it meant that there was something that I needed to work on. As the difficulty level strengthened, so did the number of “Good” moments. There were moments when doubt and worry went through my mind as well. I was worried that I had made the wrong move.  I turned to my classmates with the plea for help, they responded similarly as well. “What a relief,” I thought. It was good to know that I wasn’t the only one in class struggling because it made me realized I tricked myself into thinking that I was couldn’t do it. Finding a Job with Only Cooking ExperienceAfter graduating from Codeup and being fully aware of my imposter syndrome, I could not shake the thought of why someone would hire me. I would have to constantly remind myself that, with the skills I had from my previous work experiences and the new skills I learned over the past 18 weeks, I was more than capable. With the help of the Director of Product, Stephen Salas, I was able to find a job within one week of graduating.Goal Achieved: Now What? Maintain and Gain SkillsI got the knowledge, got the job, and got the work/life balance. Now what? Now it’s time to continue to learn and advance with your newly learned skills. One thing I realized after going through the Codeup program was that there are a lot of similarities between learning to code and learning to cook. At first, basic skills require a lot of effort and struggle, but eventually they become second nature. After the basics are understood and the muscle memory is built, then comes the never ending list of more advanced skills. When people ask me what the best part of Codeup is, I tend to respond simply with, “they taught me how to learn”. I look at new projects that I am given and when I have no idea where to start, I say “Good”, another opportunity to get better.[rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/landing-my-dream-job-through-a-web-development-course/,True,"Feb 13, 2020 | Alumni StoriesAbout a year ago I found myself between jobs, with five years of experience in law enforcement. I was actively applying for law enforcement positions because that was basically all I knew. My mother called me one afternoon and mentioned Codeup. She suggested I apply for the web development course. My first thoughts were, “There’s no way I can become a REAL developer in 18 weeks and, if I get in, I won’t  be able to keep up with the curriculum.” But, there was no risk in applying, so I did. The admissions process was smooth and any questions I had were answered by Codeup staff. Then I was accepted into the web development course!The course was challenging, but every challenge felt like an opportunity to grow. Each lesson was structured and easy to follow. The instructors give real world examples and encouraged engagement through questions and ideas. The exercises had requirements, but no limits, which allows for multiple solutions and endless possibilities. As the course progressed, I knew this was for me. Towards the end of the course, the Codeup staff connected me with potential employers based on what I was looking for. Shortly after completing the course, I received an offer letter from a software company that provides data tracking software to non-profits. I love my job. I get to build cool stuff that helps make a difference in the world while growing as a Software Engineer.My advice for anyone considering Codeup is to reach out to admissions. They would be more than happy to share what Codeup is all about and answer any questions you may have. If you’ve already been accepted, you are in good hands. The staff genuinely wants you to succeed. Try your best and you will do great.Want to chat with our Admissions Team?

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/breaking-the-mold-my-journey-to-become-a-software-developer/,True,"Jan 22, 2020 | Alumni StoriesBy Ryan Smith, Codeup AlumnusWhenever I tell someone that I’m a software developer, I generally get the surprised “You? You’re a software developer?”.I, like many others that have graduated from Codeup, don’t fit the mold most people think of when they think of people in tech.To be honest, I can barely believe that I am one as well. Throughout 12 years in school, I was a straight C or D student when it came to math or science and wasn’t super excited about college. When I graduated, instead of going to college, I became a missionary in Colombia for two years. Colombia was an intense, immersive experience and I figured that when I got back to the States I would try out college. The results? I lasted a semester in college and did horrible in my science class. My first week in college and I called a Marine Corps recruiter to let him know that I would be joining as soon as possible. College just wasn’t for me. A week after my first semester and I was in boot camp. I spent the next 5 years in The Marine Corps mostly as a military working dog handler, trainer and instructor. It was honestly the best job I ever had.Unfortunately, the military had other plans for me that didn’t involve working with dogs, so I got out and worked as a private security dog handler at the Baghdad embassy for a short time. I figured this was the next logical step. I came to find out that the job sounded good on paper, but sitting at a guard shack for 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, left me feeling unfulfilled and wanting more out of my life. A week before going back to Baghdad for the last time, I was toying with the idea of coding and came across Codeup. I was accepted into the program a couple of days later and left for Baghdad and started once I returned. Compared to all my life experiences, Codeup was mentally one of the hardest things I’ve accomplished. But if I can do it, so can you. What would have taken me years and years to accomplish, took me about 5 months. Less than two weeks after I graduated Codeup I was offered a job as a software developer at a well-known company where I’ll start in about a week.The decision to go to Codeup, give it my all and come out the other side a software developer- will affect my life in every way and also that of my future family. I’m grateful for all the staff and instructors there and thankful that I don’t just have a graduation certificate, but the actual skills I need to succeed for the rest of my life.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-paid-43-for-my-codeup-tuition/,True,"Nov 27, 2019 | Alumni StoriesBootcamps or career accelerator programs are short term education programs designed to help you learn new skills and find a job. If you are thinking about attending one, I will share some tips about finding a bootcamp, my story about how I chose to attend Codeup in San Antonio, TX and how I got funding to attend.My first tip is to spend at least a few months to a year researching the topic you want to study and the bootcamps available. There are tons of resources online to learn programming. I will provide a detailed table below of the courses I took, most of which are free. While you are learning the basics, start to learn about the bootcamps that teach this subject, read through bootcamp curriculum, take notes on tuition costs and start dates and note whether or not they provide scholarships. This first step is crucial for figuring out if this topic is something you are genuinely interested in.Secondly, when you start researching bootcamps, you will find that cost of tuition can be high. The best strategy is to look simultaneously look for funding and bootcamps. First look locally and seek out local and federal grants to attend based on being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field (minorities). I was only able to find funding because I met with a local career training program which enabled me to access local and Department of Labor funds. If you don’t meet the criteria of being being under-employed, unemployed or under-represented in the field, then don’t worry! There are still other scholarships and loans out there.Warning!—only start to contact/call up the bootcamps when you are comfortable with your basic skills in programming (or whatever you are trying to learn) and when you are committed to attending. Bootcamp admissions will aggressively seek you out. They want you to attend their courses. You should have clear intentions about what you want to do, how much money you want to spend, and how good you are at programming. Just be honest with the people you speak to about your circumstances. This is a process so take your time. Often, if you get rejected from a bootcamp, you can still re-apply later.Lastly, there are almost always loan companies that specialize in loan for students of bootcamps. If the cost of tuition is still prohibitive, you can consider loans as your last option. In most cases, these loans can be repaid easily with the job you will (hopefully, most likely) get after you graduate. Some bootcamps offer refunds if you don’t get a job (with conditions) and others offer deferred tuition where you don’t pay anything until you get your first job.As for my experience, I learned about Data Science online and spent 10 months researching the subject and bootcamps. I took a slew of courses online to learn the basics, which I will share below. Then I started to apply to bootcamps. Ultimately, I was able to find Codeup in my hometown. I visited their campus and spoke with their admissions representative about funding. I loved that this school was in my hometown, so it was a practical choice for a full-time program. I also liked the instructors and admissions people that I met. The admissions person told me about their funding options and sent me to a local career training program, which informed me about local and federal grants that were not easily accessible online. Working with this local program was long and uncertain but I stuck with it. The real reasons I was able to get funding through them were because I had been under-employed for years, I had used up all my savings, I was living at home with family and I was unemployed at the time that I applied for the funding. In the end, I chose Codeup because I was able to find funding, it was in my hometown and I genuinely liked the people I met there, especially Maggie Giust, the Senior Data Scientist.I will share a table of the exact funding amounts that I got below. This will probably not be the norm. I got extremely lucky with my funding.All in all, this whole process is precarious, scary and hard. You should give yourself plenty of time to research and learn about the process, the bootcamps and the subject you are trying to study.If you need any advice, please feel free to contact me directly.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/setting-myself-up-for-success-at-codeup/,True,"Feb 26, 2020 | Alumni StoriesLast year, I knew I needed to make a career change, but I had no idea where to begin. I had fallen into the trap of working mindless jobs only to make ends meet. I was hungry for success and ready to transition from a “job” to a “career,” but I did not know what would get me there. After conducting a lot of research, I came to the conclusion that the tech industry is where I wanted to get started, specifically as a web developer. Unfortunately, when I did a Google search for “coding bootcamp,” I came across about 6,000,000 results. Some programs offered courses online, in-person, or a combination of the two. As for the financial options, programs either offered financial assistance or none at all. I was having a difficult time choosing the best program for me because I was left with so many questions. To find answers to my questions, I decided to schedule calls with the programs I was interested in. After talking to several bootcamps, I was able to narrow down my options. I needed a program located in San Antonio, TX that offered in-person learning and tuition assistance. This was when I knew Codeup was the best possible option for me. I wanted an in-person experience because I needed an environment that would help me find the success I was after. As I did my research on Codeup, it became clear that they were going to provide the best experience for me.Now that I graduated and am looking back, I know I made the right decision. While I could mention all of the many ways that Codeup changed my life, I want to share some of the benefits for any individuals considering going here. Every day, I was taught by experienced instructors from all types of backgrounds and with various teaching styles. I had an amazing cohort that shared the journey with me and I can confidently say that I have made lifelong friends. I was also surrounded by an amazing network of alumni, staff, employer partners, and the tech community in San Antonio. Everything about Codeup is so much more effective because it is in-person. One of my favorite experiences at Codeup was the career simulation and preparation. I was able to work one-on-one with a professional that is going to help place me in my first web developer position. I feel like none of this success would have been possible if I decided to take an alternate route through an online program or part-time environment.Editor’s Update: While COVID-19 remains prevalent, classes will be conducted online as a necessity. However, the live online classroom simulates an in-person environment with video lecture and lab, breakout rooms, office hours, reviews, exams, and more, right alongside your cohort! The career simulation and preparation hasn’t ended, in fact, it’s even more developed! Learn more about Codeup Remote, here.Going to school full-time was not an easy task, but here is how I made it possible:  If you are considering Codeup’s web development program, my advice is that you ask yourself if you are ready to commit to changing your career and ultimately your life in five months. A full-time program is not easy, but the outcome is going to be worth it if you put in hard work. Remember that you are not sacrificing your time, but are instead investing in a better version of you.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Beverly Jaimes-Puente is a Web Developer in the San Antonio area.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/styling-hair-stying-interfaces/,True,"Nov 7, 2018 | Alumni Stories, Behind the BillboardsBy Sukari SchutzmanI grew up loving technology. I still remember thinking that my grandmothers’ flip phone in 1995 was the coolest thing I had ever seen. As a child, I took all my electronic toys apart, because I was curious what was inside. So you can say, I always yearned for a career in tech.My name is Sukari Schutzman. I don’t take myself too seriously, I’m always laughing, and trying to share positive energy, but most importantly I am a software developer.When I got my cosmetology license, I was passionate about doing hair. I wanted to learn how to be better, and how to perfect my craft. In many ways, I see a lot of parallels in cosmetology, and in software development. Drawing those parallels kept me strong in the program and reminded me to never give up. I remembered when I was in cosmetology school, or when I was in the salon and I was stuck on something, I always asked for help. In software development and at Codeup, the same rings true.I had always driven by the billboards on I-10 on my way into San Antonio and was ALWAYS confused. “Software Developer? Why is ‘Retail Manager’ crossed out? What is that?”, I always wondered. But I always continued to drive on and thought nothing of it when I reached my destination.I decided development was for me and wanted to transition into it and learn how to code, as I had been exposed to it for a while. I knew self-study would not work for me. I needed to be in a classroom and knew I needed to be in front of an instructor. But most importantly, I needed a job ASAP because I needed to support myself and my child.When I arrived at Codeup and went on the tour I was amazed. I knew this would be the place for me, and it was going to be where I knew my life would change. I was going to be walking out of one door and into another. And I wasn’t going to look back.When I found out that I had got in, I was so happy that my hard work paid off and I knew it was just the beginning of what was to come. I looked forward to the start date and marked it on my calendar. I also quit my job, which was much needed because salon life was stressful enough, let alone learning a new skill.The next few months were filled with triumphs and failures, which is normal in any career. No one is born good at everything, it takes practice and determination (I totally had to repeat that to myself every single day at Codeup. Thanks Ryan!). Sometimes it felt like two steps back, but I was determined to make it to Demo Day and present my Capstone.With the help of Codeup staff, I felt set up to succeed at Demo Day. But most of all, I felt prepared for my new career.Demo Day finally came! Our project got the most compliments on the visual interface, which I worked hard on, and helped us stand out amongst our classmates. I had a few interviews set up for within a week after Demo Day and landed my first job. At this point, I was in awe. Everything I worked hard for had finally came to fruition. And most of all, I didn’t have to work weekends unless I wanted to.There’s nothing wrong with being a hairstylist, absolutely not! However, it just wasn’t for me anymore. Thanks to Codeup, my life is so different now.And for that, I am eternally grateful.Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

I didn’t have any major goals or expected to make any life-changing decisions, then I lost my best friend, my mentor in life.Tito Bradshaw lived life to the fullest and was a leader in the cycling community. This death kickstarted me onto a path to change my life and do more than I ever thought I was capable of. Like Tito, I decided to go on an adventure and explore New York, push my body past its limits in strength and endurance and somehow I ended up in the right place at the right time and met some people from Codeup.I always thought I would just be in sales my entire life and have an uneventful life, this year I have done more than I could have ever imagined. Conversations went from “Look how much I sold!” to “Look what I programmed!!!”.I am so humbled to end this year not as “Eddy the Sales guy” but as a Software Developer! I’m excited to land my first dev role, explore new city’s and most importantly give back to my community. I know if Tito was here he would be proud.____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Eddy Bautista is a Full Stack Web Development Alumni, follow him on Linkedin to hear more about his journey! Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/why-im-thankful-for-codeup/,True,"Nov 21, 2018 | Alumni StoriesBy Amy Yanaway Almost every day since graduating from Codeup in December 2017, I have meditated over how much my life has changed in such a short period of time. Especially during this Thanksgiving season, I took the time to reflect even more deeply about the top three reasons I am grateful for Codeup. I am thankful for: When they say that Codeup is a “career accelerator,” they are not joking! In just 18 weeks, you graduate with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the industry as a junior developer. When I was first searching for options to learn how to code, I was told that any college degree program would take me two to four full-time years, or four or more part-time years, to finish. As we all know, our bills do not get put on hold while we are in school! I also looked into free or inexpensive part-time programs so that I could continue to work full-time, and although I would describe myself as diligent and able to handle self-study, this would also have been a long route, and without the career advice and connections Codeup provides. Knowing what I know now, I am so glad I didn’t try to study on my own. The depth of Codeup’s curriculum, compared to some online training I have tried, is unmatched and very important to have in my current work as a developer.When you think about it, 18 weeks is a blip in your life, especially when that blip of time in Codeup very quickly produces a return on your investment. Remember to consider wages lost when making your decision: your time is VALUABLE, and time spent not in the workforce is wages lost that you could have been making. Speaking of finances, I am also thankful for…Did you know that many students receive internal scholarships and financial help from Codeup’s funding partners? I, too, had sticker shock when I saw the price tag, but I ended up receiving Codeup’s Women in Tech scholarship, as well as a grant from Project Quest, which greatly reduced my cost. For the remaining balance, I utilized one of Codeup’s loan partners, which offers reduced payments while in school, and for two months after. Read more about my journey through Codeup here. Last but not least, I am thankful for…Until just a few years ago, I had never in my life met a computer programmer. I was not aware that this was a thriving career, or that development and IT jobs occupy many of the slots on Glassdoor’s list of top careers. For several years, I was stuck in another field that was not for me, and I spent a lot of time thinking about how to get my foot in the door of this industry that seemed like it would better suit me and my needs. However, I did not have any connections in the industry or the direction needed to do this myself.Codeup provided access to the tech field to me, as a woman who knew nothing about code prior to attending, and as someone who constantly doubted (and still do sometimes) whether I would be able to grasp what I had heard was very difficult subject matter. They saw potential in my aptitude and, more importantly, in my attitude. Life since Codeup has been incredible. My job is fun, challenging, and stimulating; most of the time, it feels like I’m working on jigsaw puzzles all day. The hours just fly by, and I can’t believe I’m getting paid for this! Sometimes, when that pesky ol’ imposter syndrome pops up, a coworker of mine will brag about the quality or speed of my work to my supervisor, and I’ll feel validated and appreciated all over again, despite my newness to the field. Financially, I also feel appreciated, as I am now a skilled worker in high demand. In fact, in less than a year since graduating from Codeup, I was able to purchase my first home, all by myself!This truly has been a life changing year. Codeup got me in the door of the tech industry, and where I go from here is up to me. This Thanksgiving, I am humbly grateful for finally being able to carve out my place in the world, and I hope the same for you. Happy Thanksgiving, y’all!—Amy is very proud to say she is currently the only female developer employee working on Whataburger’s first ever online ordering platform. She has a Master’s degree in Music Theory and keeps that knowledge fresh by analyzing music on the radio during her daily commute. Since learning to code, what she enjoys most is mentoring new developers.  [rev_slider alias=”footer”][/rev_slider]Submit your email address to gain access to more information about our programs, financial aid, and benefits.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/codeup-prepared-career/,True,"Nov 28, 2018 | Alumni StoriesBy Joyce Yueh Yueh LingIn four months, a lot can change. Four months: A San Antonio winter, a long distance relationship, a college semester. During my four months at Codeup, I pursued what felt like an unattainable goal and actually reached it. When I tell people that I’ve been coding less than a year and am now working as a software developer, people are usually impressed. But to be frank, I could never have done that without attending a coding boot camp like Codeup. It was a short four-month process that was like stumbling from a dusty, old wardrobe into Narnia: on one side, a clumsy and unenlightened beginner and thereafter being transformed by a completely new and fantastical world. Attending Codeup armed me with the experience and knowledge that allowed me to survive the harsh winter landscape that starting out from scratch as a software developer can be. Now as I am working at my first real job, I’m grateful to Codeup for teaching me several things that allowed me to be better prepared for my career.From beginning to end, Codeup placed a huge emphasis on group exercises. The beginning of the course was characterized by paired programming, a process in which one person is the navigator and one is the driver. As the names suggest, the navigator communicates with the person at the keyboard and directs them to type certain bits of code or navigate to specific elements on the page. Often, we would flip-flop between these roles so both students could get a crack at practicing one of two things: Firstly, we practiced how to communicate clearly and efficiently. Secondly, we learned how to take direction and ask clarifying questions. At the time, I wasn’t sure what the big deal was with paired programming and why the instructors at Codeup had made it such an integral part of the curriculum. However, as I go about my everyday duties at work, I realized how often I engage in informal bouts of paired programming. Although we have a Wikipedia-style knowledge base at my work where we document our processes, a lot of knowledge is still transferred orally (not ideal, but we’re working on it!). What this means is that paired programming happens on a daily basis. If a developer is having a complex problem, it is usually easier for a coworker who has solved this problem before to sit down and walk them through it rather than try to explain things via chat or email.Towards the end of the semester, we coalesced into group projects in which the primary focus was teamwork. This was where we got a taste of working independently but in a team effort. It was during the group projects that I discovered the importance of learning how to use a versioning control system, such as GitHub, that allowed multiple developers to participate on the same project without stepping on any toes. When I started my job at Armor, I realized how much more complex versioning control can get when you have potentially 50+ people contributing to the same repository at any given time. I had to relearn the fundamentals and be extra careful not to overwrite someone else’s work. Most mistakes are reversible, but the headache of figuring out what went wrong and how to fix it is usually a source of distraction from a developer’s daily duties and sprint goals.When I initially started at Codeup, I found myself wanting to ask the instructors questions as soon as I got stuck on something. However, I quickly realized that their resources were limited since there were only 2 of them (plus 1-2 fellows) in a class of 30. Although this wasn’t ideal, it actually did simulate a real-life scenario that parallels a professional working environment. At my work, there are probably only 2 or 3 lead developers. However,  they are constantly inundated with requests by QE and other junior developers, code review, and demands from management. If you need to make a request, best make it quick and efficient. I then remembered what instructors had mentioned during Codeup. They taught us that if you have a question, make sure you present it in a format such as:This made it so that students would actually try to figure out a solution before shooting their hand up every time they had a problem, only to find that they could have easily solved it with a little more digging. In my experience, most experienced developers are usually happy to help. However, it’s good practice to make sure to demonstrate you tried your best and that you’re not wasting their precious time. Throughout the boot camp, it came to be a running joke that everyone would have an emotional breakdown at least once during their time at Codeup. You would see someone walk off and come back with teary, red eyes. Or for some, they would vocalize their despair: “I don’t think I’m cut out for this.”, “This is too hard.”, “I’m so frustrated!”, “Maybe I should just give up.” I myself broke down emotionally several times during Codeup and reiterated several mental self-doubts to myself: “Maybe I should have stuck to the arts. I’m too emotional to do well in computer science. I’ll never be good enough”. On some days, you would feel accomplished and confident in your abilities. On other days, the doubts would flood in unexpectedly and endanger everything I had worked so hard for. However, through the support of other students in the class, the instructors, and the encouragement of the staff, I was able to succeed throughout the course and completed my Demo Day project. All this is to say, Codeup taught me to have emotional fortitude and a confidence to believe in myself. Because to be honest, the first several months at my job also felt like an emotional roller coaster. I was thrown into an environment where I had to learn and adapt very quickly.  I was constantly afraid and timid because I was the only female developer and also the most junior developer. I expected a lot out of myself, and when I was given criticism I would internally berate myself until my negative self-talk had multiplied the original piece of criticism in my mind ten-fold of what it actually was.However, my experience at Codeup had taught me to push through in those moments of self-doubt. It gave me a thicker skin in order to ask for help, to learn quickly amidst a ton of ambiguity, and most importantly, a realization that it will always get better as long as I don’t give upAs you might have noticed, none of the points above are actually related to the technical knowledge I received by attending Codeup and how it affected my career. It goes without saying that Codeup provided me with the coding skills I needed to be succeed in my career. However, another point that our instructors emphasized was that Codeup was not a comprehensive coding academy or computer science degree. In some ways, it was like a tour bus that allowed you a brief overview of all the major stops in the area. It allowed us to have the impetus and catalytic energy to start off a software development career. It also gave us the tools to quickly be able to pick up any technologies our companies were using. “We’re teaching you how to learn,” they would say throughout the course. After starting my first job, I came to realize how true this statement was. I imagined myself trying to pick up the technologies at my job without having Codeup as a primer and it seemed near impossible.Needless to say, Codeup was an essential experience I needed on the way to becoming a full-time software developer. I learned critical skills that have proved invaluable in my day-to-day and have allowed me to be where I am today.— Joyce is a full time software developer at Armor, a cloud security company in Richardson, TX.

At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

https://www.coursereport.com/schools/codeup?shared_review=23188#reviews,True,"Dallas, San AntonioAvg Rating:4.62 ( 50 reviews )Avg Rating:4.62 ( 50 reviews )Codeup is an immersive 22-week, in-person full stack web development, and data science career accelerator in San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston. The Full Stack Web Development Java program covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Spring, and MySQL. The Data Science Program covers Python, SQL, data visualization, data analytics, data wrangling, and statistics. Codeup guarantees all graduates a job offer within six months of graduation.Prospective students must submit a brief online application, interview with the Codeup team, and then pass a 40-minute test covering word problems, logic problems, and basic algebra. The application process is looking for three things: professionalism, motivation, and problem-solving ability. The most successful Codeup students are prepared to jump into careers as developers and data scientists, have a true motivation to become developers and enjoy the challenge of solving complex problems.  Codeup has a dedicated staff, employer network, and community partnerships to help students land entry-level positions in software development or data science. Students receive help on the job search through workshops, job fairs, and one-on-one support to navigate the tech industry.AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTSBest Decision Ever Made CodeUp50 reviews sorted by:Filtered by:Reviewer Context:Demographics: I am a female between 18-30 years old. I was hired about a month before Codeup even ended as an associate data engineer. It's been a year since then, and I am still with the same company.Experience before Codeup: I have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I did a year of Comp Sci classes at university before I dropped out to go to Codeup. Before Codeup I was an Assistant Manager at a major clothing brand. Cost: I only had to pay the deposit of ~$1000-$1500. The rest was covered by a city grant and a 'women in tech' scholarship.  Overall Experience:Life-changing. I can confidently say that Codeup did more for me than years of the university did. I was reluctant at first until I looked up their job placement statistics. 87%! Numbers don't lie. It is a risk for sure, but the incredible payoff is worth it. I would not be at my current job if not for Codeup. Instructors: You're taught by several different instructors throughout the course. It's nice because if you don't vibe with one instructor, it won't be forever. It's not for you if you expect the instructors to give you all the answers. You wouldn't expect your manager to give you all the answers!  Curriculum:The curriculum is something that anyone can learn on their own. The difference is that Codeup provides structure and context. The level of difficulty depends on your prior experience. It is quite intense, with a fast learning pace. With dedication, anyone can do it. There are student-led study sessions and instructor-provided tutoring. Codeup is very good at teaching you the most important aspects of a language or technology and leaving the rest up to you. They give you a great learning foundation and you learn HOW to learn. As a developer, you never stop learning, so this is a great skill to have! Job Assistance: The job assistance is extensive and extremely helpful. This is the best part of Codeup in my opinion. There is job placement staff that assist you throughout the process. Your resume is viewed and critiqued several times. You will have mock interviews. You will design your own personal website. Your LinkedIn will be critiqued.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate.Flag as inappropriate. 100% of students intended to seek in-field employment within 180 days of graduating. 0% of students did not intend to seek in-field employment.Below is the 180 Day Employment Breakdown for 56 graduates included in report: Dallas, San AntonioCertified as a Career School through the Texas Workforce Commission.

https://codeup.com/program/full-stack-web-developme/codeup-news/inclusion-at-codeup-during-pride-month-and-always/,True,"Jun 4, 2021 | Codeup NewsHappy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/the-message-behind-our-billboards/,True,"Sep 17, 2018 | Behind the Billboards, Codeup NewsYou may have seen Codeup’s billboards around town featuring recent career transitioners. We’ve featured former law students, baristas, hairstylists, military veterans, and more. We’ve recently heard that the advertising has offended people from those professions, so we want to explain our message more clearly.Codeup’s mission is to help individuals in transition change their futures by providing a fast and effective entry point into a tech career. We believe that everyone should have access to the new tech economy and that you don’t need any specific background to do so.That’s why we feature REAL graduates of our program who have started new careers from a diverse set of backgrounds. Luke used to be a soldier, Mars was a barista and bartender, John was studying law, and Sukari was a hairstylist. We’re not saying those weren’t real jobs! And we’re not saying software development is better for you. We ARE saying that each of our students chose software development for their own reasons. We highlight those stories to show that YOU, regardless of what career you have now, CAN become a software developer IF that’s what you want.Don’t just listen to us – listen to the real students whose stories are up on those billboards!PREVIOUS HAIRSTYLIST AND CODEUP ALUMNA, SUKARI S., EXCITED TO SEE HER BILLBOARD COPY GOING UP THIS PAST MAY!PREVIOUS HAIRSTYLIST AND CODEUP ALUMNA, SUKARI S., EXCITED TO SEE HER BILLBOARD COPY GOING UP THIS PAST MAY!Sukari S. (Previously a Hair Stylist): “I discovered I really liked software development: the process, the code… I wanted to immerse myself fully into it, so I decided to go to Codeup to better myself with a new career. Codeup changed my life for the best. It made my career transition as smooth as possible, and I’m super grateful. Now I have weekends back to spend with my toddler son!”John H. (Previously studying Law): “I was in law school simply for the reason it seemed like the next logical step for my degree. Like a lot of people trying new things, once I got into it I discovered it wasn’t for me. When I started seeing the Codeup billboards, it gave me another option for something I could do that I had never tried before. It was something that could offer me a good, solid, steady career that I hadn’t considered. By no means is a law degree bad – lots of people are lawyers and take care of themselves. It’s just that Codeup was there to offer an alternative when I needed one.”Amy Y. (Previously an Admissions Counselor): “I went into higher education because I had so many years of personal experience going through admissions, applying for financial aid, and planning my degree plan, and I enjoyed helping others through this process as well. However, even with a Master’s degree, I was in very entry-level positions and struggled for many years to advance to higher positions. I didn’t feel like my skill set or passion was being appreciated, so a programmer friend of mine directed me to Codeup. The transition into the tech industry has been life-changing, and as a programmer in my current job, I feel personally valued on a daily basis. The path for growth and advancement is clear, and I’m never looking back!”We believe that each person should choose their own path, and degrees and diplomas don’t define you.

https://codeup.com/data-science/data-science-student-experience/,True,"Jun 5, 2020 | Behind the Billboards, Data ScienceOur Transition into Data Science Panel event was full of passion. The audience met three of our current students: Jada Shipp, formerly a Newborn Hearing Specialist, Daniel Guerrero, who was a Vaccine Product Manager, and Ryan McCall, who was an overnight Surveillance Agent at Walmart. They discussed what led them to this career path, how their Data Science bootcamp experience has been so far, and what they plan to do after Codeup. Read on to learn about the Codeup Data Science bootcamp experience and their key takeaways and advice! The students began by discussing their “whys” and “hows” of pursuing data science at Codeup.Jada: I was going to apply to medical school but decided it wasn’t for me. A friend suggested Codeup, which is how I learned about data science. I realized it’s something I was already interested in. I was really big on solving all my problems in school on Excel and coming up with the best graphs and digging around in numbers. I just didn’t know there was a name for this, and certainly didn’t know it was a career path.Daniel: At a new job as a Vaccine Product Manager, they started asking me to do research about where we’re selling our product and who’s buying. I quickly discovered this was a massive, billion dollar company and there was no one there that actually knew how to use Excel or how to look at sales. It was mind blowing to me because I thought this was standard and everyone was doing it. Then I realized my company is not the only one that has this gap.Ryan: I went to college for chemistry, then started working security but wasn’t satisfied with it. I wanted to use my brain more to think and actively solve problems at my job. So, I started looking at programming as a job career. I found data science and absolutely fell in love with it and spent two years trying to teach it to myself on the side of my security job. It was very hard, I spent most of that time figuring out what resources to trust. It’s a lot easier being taught than searching in the dark. Lots of us know how it feels to come out of a full semester of class feeling like we didn’t absorb anything and not knowing how it applies to real life. Not here.Jada: I thought getting admitted was a mistake and they’d kick me out at any time. I had zero coding experience and I really didn’t think I could do it. But I went step by step. ‘Maybe I can’t do this but I can probably do this one tiny part of it.’ They’ll explain it in as many different ways as they need to until your lightbulb goes on. Daniel: They’ll give you questions that force you to think. They won’t just give you an answer. You have to figure it out yourself but they give you the tools to be able to do that. And because of the collaborative environment, we’re learning from each other as a cohort and not just instructors. Now, I’m able to branch out into new territories and not be scared to do so because I’m well equipped.Ryan: I’m honestly amazed by what we can do in such a short amount of time. I can do things that I thought it would take me years to do. In such an immersive, fast-paced environment, it was a joy to hear how much our students have loved their experience so far.Jada: Everything we do every week, I’m like “This is so cool! Last week was nothing!”Daniel: Every week I have the same conversation with my parents about the program. “What are you doing this week?” “Oh it’s my favorite thing!” “You say that every week!” But other than everything, the projects are the coolest thing for me.Ryan: We could talk about this for hours, we love this stuff! Aside from loving the material, you become like a little family. We’ve had all the same bad experiences, all the same good experiences. You’re speaking a similar language and you can figure it out together. In between lessons, students work closely with our placement team, where we help students land awesome jobs.Jada: I want to use data in health care. I have a degree in Public Health and worked as an EMT, a scribe, and a hearing screener. Now, I want to merge my passion for public health with data science skills. I’m pretty confident I can get a job like this because the Codeup placement team helps you through every step– resume, Linkedin, interview skills. They are not gonna let you fall by the wayside. They remember you and who you are and what you’re looking for. It’s not a generic cookie cutter process where you get what you get. They know you and it’s customized for you.Daniel: I told the placement team that I want to work with data that’s business to customer. Two days later they sent me applications and they’re actually what I asked for, in industries I actually told them about, with companies I actually mentioned. I was mind blown! The placement team will open as many doors as they possibly can to get you the right opportunity, I am more than impressed with the placement team.Ryan: I want to be a data scientist and I don’t know what kind of data scientist, I just want to be one! And they can work with that, too! All three panelists said the same thing: DO THE PREWORK!   We want to thank Jada, Daniel, and Ryan for sharing their passion with us and acting as mentors for prospective and current students for the night. They are each blossoming into data scientists that couldn’t hide how much they love what they do even if they tried. Do you want a similar transition?

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.

https://codeup.com/alumni-stories/how-i-went-from-codeup-to-bus/index.php/,True,"Apr 30, 2021 | Alumni StoriesOut of college, I was a bit of a mess. That’s what I would have told you, anyway. On the surface, I was put together. I graduated magna cum laude with a 3.8 in Molecular Biology, had professor recommendations under my belt, and a clear goal to apply for a PhD program in Clinical Psychology.But as I sat in the dry Colorado sunshine on graduation day, this thought popped into my head: “I never have to go to school EVER again…” As soon as I crossed the finish line, it nauseated me to think about going back to school right away. But I felt lost. If I wasn’t going to graduate school, I didn’t have a plan anymore. What the hell was I supposed to do? Being naive and idealistic, I considered applying to the Peace Corps. My brother-in-law (bless his heart) sat me down and explained that the beginning of my career was critical. He also mentioned that it takes about a year to save up for a year of not working; otherwise, I’d have to keep depending on my parents who had already supported me through college. Being bratty and unaware of how the world works, I rolled my eyes at his perfectly logical explanations, convinced he was obsessed with making money. I sat on my high horse, lauding myself for being willing to make a sacrifice when I literally had nothing to my name. In reality, I felt lost. I didn’t recognize it at the time, but going to the Peace Corps was an excuse to run away from uncertainty. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in life, and I also had these lofty dreams of maybe starting my own business one day or being a part of a movement that mattered. Sensing these hopes in me, my brother-in-law mentioned he had seen billboards around town for a coding bootcamp named Codeup. If I didn’t know what I wanted to “do”, then maybe I could build my skillset instead. My interest was piqued. Coding seemed cool. I pictured savvy devs in cute plaid shirts and man buns, and being able to live the #vanlife and become a digital nomad. (are you noticing my habit of being idealistic yet?). Buoyed by this vision, I jumped all-in. I told myself I’d go to every happy hour, mixer, network like crazy, and bond with every single one of my classmates. It worked. I landed a job in software development at a cloud security company in Dallas. After spending a year in the Engineering department of my company, I had finally come to face the reality that I wasn’t very good at coding. More importantly, I was pretty apathetic about mastering it. If I continued down my career path as a developer, I’d have to keep learning and keeping up with the latest trends in development, and nothing in me felt excited about that. I was given an opportunity to join the Marketing department as a Digital Marketing Manager. At first, I felt guilty for even considering it. Did my parents spend their hard-earned money putting me through Codeup, only for me to give it all up because I was bored? It seemed like a sin straight out of the immigrant rulebook. My dream to love what I do was “selfish” and having a sense of purpose was a “luxury”. Eventually though, I braced myself and took the leap.It was one of the best decisions I ever made. I finally felt like I was “with my people”, a collection of brainy empaths with crazy ideas. I learned so much about marketing in general, which allowed me to start up my side business as a coach. I launched my first group coaching course in 2020, and I’m writing a book to release at the start of 2022. I’m living my dream every day, learning and growing with exciting things at every turn. I’ve connected with other coaches, and built a supportive web of connections across the globe. I can’t believe how far I’ve come. But I couldn’t have done it without first building my skills. In a world that penalizes people for not fitting into a neat career category, it can sometimes get confusing for people who have lots of interests. But I realized I didn’t get here by trying to become a business owner or learn about marketing. I was just, A, open to the opportunity, and B, perfectly positioned to do so. Going through Codeup was a huge incentive for the Marketing manager to hire me, despite the fact I had ZERO marketing experience. They figured, hey, if she can learn full-stack in four months, she can definitely learn the lay of the land in marketing. My exposure to marketing gave me the necessary courage and skills to start getting my content out there. I was writing blogs, publishing podcasts, and releasing YouTube videos.With a clear mission and vision in mind, everything fell into place. It’s not that I suddenly have everything figured out; instead, I’ve gotten used to the uncertainty. I no longer worry about what my career is going to be. I know it’s not going to be “one thing”. I won’t be a coder, a writer, or a coach. I’ll be a coder-writer-coach-podcaster-marketer-salesperson-youtuber-novelist. Why choose, when I know I can make money from my unique mix of skills? Society often suggests we have to choose. But I refuse to believe that anymore. If you’re reading this and you’re uncertain about where you’re headed, it’s okay not to have all the answers. Take things day by day. Build your skillset. Follow what you love. Aim for mastery. And don’t rule out the 9-to-5 doing something you may not love. Your job doesn’t have to be your passion. A steady paycheck does wonders for anxiety and allows you to be creative and innovate in your side-hustles. Practice gratitude. Realize that, yes, things could be worse, but they can also be better. Be patient with learning to wobble on the thin line stretched between “This is enough” and “I wonder what would happen if…”Go down the rabbit holes. Be curious. And realize that life is about embracing the possibilities. Who knows where it can lead?Joyce Ling is a content creator and coach that helps dreamers fulfill their purpose by doing the work that matters most.

https://codeup.com/why-should-you-become-a-web-developer/,True,"Jan 25, 2021 | Full Stack Web DevelopmentThere are some things we all look for in a career. Job security, good compensation, work/life balance, personal fulfillment – all of these can be found in a career as a developer! There’s lots of demand for them, but not nearly enough of them. Despite stereotypes, web developers can actually find their work very engaging and personally rewarding, and the world certainly needs them. It’s a solid career path, with room for growth – both personal and professional. Keep reading to learn why you should become a web developer! The demand for web developers is ever increasing. There are currently about 1,504,895 developer jobs, and 250,000 of them remain open. The 10-year growth predicted in 2019 was 8%, a rate that’s much faster than the average for all occupations. But the talent pool isn’t keeping up. In fact, Codeup was founded in 2013 by employers that couldn’t find the talent they needed to fill their development roles. This significant gap between supply and demand is a constant stretching from Silicon Valley to New York City, and probably further. For anything you need or need to know, your first touchpoint is the internet. We’ve ditched physical dictionaries and encyclopedias in favor of a Google search. Friendships and networking now exist online, and the activity of “going shopping” has been replaced with e-commerce for everything from electronics, to clothing, to education, even groceries (HEB has been dethroned by Amazon). This stark technical shift isn’t going to go away, especially now that companies have been forced to adapt to doing business online. Every company needs an interactive website with an equally interactive mobile version to stay afloat. While traditionally brick and mortar companies remove storefronts and go paperless, human-facing staff are being downsized in favor of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automatic, responsive applications (think salespeople and customer service agents). However, they will always need people to program that AI, code the applications, and protect all the new networks and infrastructure from being hacked. Job security is one thing you won’t have to worry much about as a skilled developer. There truly are not enough in the market, and you can help bridge that gap while also building a fulfilling career! Reason #2 of why you should become a web developer is to have the security and stability you’ve always wanted. As mentioned earlier, the ever-growing need for developers will ensure your job security for years to come, so long as you stay up to date with the newest languages (more on that later). It’s no secret that landing your first developer job is going to be tough. That’s true whether you’re a Computer Science grad, a bootcamp grad, or self-taught. (Codeup does everything we can to streamline your job hunt.) But once you’re in, you will rarely find yourself out of a job. Web developers boast a tiny unemployment rate of 2.5%. That feeling of knowing your skillset will be in demand well into the future is priceless. It’s a career, not a job, and your compensation and benefits will reflect such. Gone are the days of clocking in and out for bathroom breaks, not seeing your family, being called in, and asking to work overtime to get more hours. Welcome to the days of a stable and flexible work schedule, health insurance, retirement contributions, and a good salary! The average starting salaries are:Those are some good looking numbers for your very first development job. And salary offers drastically increase after you pass “entry level.” Average salaries are:Senior Web Developers have at least 5 years of experience, but some companies require more. Even still, there’s potential to nearly double your salary in just a couple years. A few years more and six figures, here you come! Look, coding is tough stuff! You can equate it to learning Spanish, then German, then all of a sudden, French is all the rage. Meanwhile, your colleagues may speak it a little differently than you, using a different word order to deliver the same message. This career path is one of continuous learning and evolution:This career path is for highly motivated individuals that are okay with constant learning, shifting, and growth. Job satisfaction is an ambiguous thing to measure. Some things that go into it are job security, compensation, ability to grow, and personal fulfillment, all of which we touch on here. Other elements are work/life balance, quality of leadership, colleagues, and appreciation from others, which vary from person to person and from job to job. You’ll be happy to know that the majority of developers, at a whopping 63%, are satisfied with their jobs.

https://codeup.com/hous/codeup-news/inclusion-at-codeup-during-pride-month-and-always/,True,"Jun 4, 2021 | Codeup NewsHappy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.

Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so.

https://codeup.com/codeup-news/meet-the-new-codeup-co/codeup-news/inclusion-at-codeup-during-pride-month-and-always/,True,"Jun 4, 2021 | Codeup NewsHappy Pride Month! Pride Month is a dedicated time to celebrate and support the LGBTQIA+ community. At Codeup, one of our core values is Cultivating Inclusive Growth, something that takes on many shapes, sizes, forms, and colors. From representation in tech to empowering and supporting all, let’s reflect on how we live out this core value for our LGBTQIA+ community, not just during Pride Month, but always.We’re firm believers that the people making tech should look like the people using it, which is everyone. We’re proud to offer Pride Scholarships year round, which aim to increase, support, and promote representation of the LGBTQIA+ community in tech. However, representation is only one part of cultivating inclusive growth. We want to help create a thriving tech community where everyone feels represented, but also safe and empowered.In a 2019 survey conducted by Blind, 83% of LGBQ technologists and 78% of trans or gender non-conforming technologists reported that they felt safe in the workplace. In 2020, those numbers dropped to 76% and 64%, respectively. Why the drop? Maybe recent pushes for representation in tech weren’t followed up with efforts to truly cultivate inclusivity and growth.To cultivate inclusive growth, we don’t stop at representation. We also empower and support our community so that no one feels unsafe. Our internal DEI Taskforce empowers our staff with resources and conversations that aim to create a diverse culture of support, safety, and inclusivity for each other and our students. Equipped with this knowledge, our staff can cultivate inclusive growth from the first time they interact with an applicant all the way until they get placed into a new job. They may have even felt empowered just by seeing our students and staff sporting their Pride t-shirts around town. You can get yours on our merch store! The proceeds support our Pride Scholarship.Not only do we want the people making tech to look like the people using it, we also want them to feel safe and empowered to do so. If you’re looking for a career in tech, let us empower you every step of the way! First, apply now.
